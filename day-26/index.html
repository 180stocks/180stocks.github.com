    <p>In the introductory chapters of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Uncommon-Profits-Writings-Investment-Classics/dp/0471119288"><em>"Common
Stocks and Uncommon Profits"</em></a>,
Philip Fisher looks at inflation in terms of money
depreciation over a long period. I computed
the parallel figures for Indian environment.</p>
<p><img alt="Inflation in India" src="http://180stocks.github.io/static/uploads/inflation.png" /></p>
<p>The average rate of inflation in India has
been 8.07%. Thus in 10 years, the purchasing
power depreciates by 54%, and in 20 years it
depreciates by 77%.</p>
<p>The initial chapters also talked about why a good
growth company must be investing in research
and provided a few <em>scuttlebutt</em>
techniques. Will try to find atleast one
company which has been investing in research
and try to apply the scuttlebutt
techniques in the upcoming week.</p>
<p>In stocks, I had a look at Bharat Agri
Fertilizers and Reality. The numbers look
interesting, but the profits are mainly
from the real-estate business. I couldn't find
their website or much details about their
projects. Thus left the analysis after a
cursory glance.</p>
