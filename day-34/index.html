    <p>Chapter 43 of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Security-Analysis-Edition-Foreword-Editions/dp/0071592539"><em>Security Analysis</em></a> talks
about bargains trading below their liquidation
value. One of the stocks that looked interesting
in this category was <a href="http://www.sunilhitech.com/">Sunil Hitech Engineers
Ltd.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sunil Hitech is engaged in the niche segment of
Fabrication, Erection &amp; Testing and
Commissioning of Bunkers, ESPs, Boilers, TG sets
in the Power Plants, both in Private &amp; Public
sector.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though the company has a huge debt of around
Rs.370 crores, the market capitalization of
Rs.131 crores looked interesting. Against this,
the company carries net current assets of over 600
crores.</p>
<p>Using the rules of valuation for companies with
"speculative capital structure" as prescribed in
the Chapter 40 of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Security-Analysis-Edition-Foreword-Editions/dp/0071592539">book</a>, I valued the
company as a whole at around Rs.500 crores
<sup id="fnref:valuation"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:valuation" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. The current valuation of the company
is Rs.501 crores (370 + 131). Due to the high
leveraging, an improvement in the operating
margins, or recovery of receivables, or new
bulk-orders in can increase the bottom-line
significantly.</p>
<p><strong>As I began to dig more into the stock, however, a
great example of financial engineering sprang
up.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Last year the company passed a resolution to
allot 80 lac preferential warrants convertible
into shares to the promoters and FIIs.</strong> The company
currently has a total of 1.2 crore outstanding
shares. <strong>That is a dilution of over 66% for the
minority share holders.</strong> Further interesting
points about these warrants are that they are
priced at Rs.73 per warrant. Of this, only 25% is
to be paid at the time of allotment of warrant,
and the rest 75% at the time of conversion. The
quarterly results published by the company don't
show the diluted EPS (probably because the
warrants haven't been allotted yet).</p>
<p><strong>After considering the diluted equity, the fair
value per shares dropped by half - the stock
ceased to looked exciting even from the
"speculative" angles.</strong></p>
