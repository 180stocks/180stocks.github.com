    <p>I <a href="http://180stocks.github.io/static/uploads/average_earning.xlsx">screened</a> for companies based on the <a href="http://180stocks.github.io/day-19/">"Theory of
Common-Stock Investment"</a>.</p>
<p>One of the names that came up was <a href="http://www.denora.com/">De
Nora</a>. The company's balance sheet looked
interesting as the company had bought-back shares
in the last two years at Rs.92 (current price is
Rs.101). The dividend payout also looked very
attractive (with yield of 7%). But going through
quarterly results, it turned out that there was a
one time profit of 6.21 Crores during September
2012 and that was deviating the ratios. On
removing the income from that quarter, the average
earnings shot-up.</p>
<p>Most other companies in the list too had similar
one-off items, or the companies were in their
dying stages. It was still interesting to go
through the annual reports of some of them to know
about their reasons for downfall.</p>
