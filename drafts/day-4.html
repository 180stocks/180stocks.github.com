    <p>I looked at <a href="http://www.screener.in/company/?q=532493">Astral Microwave</a> on <a href="../day-2/">Day 2</a>, while looking at defense companies. The stock looked interesting as it was showing a very good year-on-year growth and yet available at multi-year low (at a market capitalization of 276 crores).</p>
<p>I began reading the company's 2006 annual report. It was an exceptional year as the company's top-line grew by over 50%. Net profit that year was of 37 crores (and has stayed below it until 2013). That year company declared a 1:1 bonus (along with a stock split in 5:1 ratio). The R&amp;D expenditure was 18% of revenue and the annual report was pretty optimistic about the future.</p>

<p>I looked at the <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/stock-charts/astramicrowaveproducts/charts/AMP01#AMP01">historical price</a> chart to find that the market had been even more optimistic and had valued the company at whooping 1000 crores (37 times its annual earnings).</p>
<p>Next year, company reported the <em>"end of major production orders of ground based radar sub-system which dominated both the top line and bottom line growth of the company in the last two financial years."</em></p>
<p><strong>Lesson of the day was never to overpay for a stock, no matter how tempting the prospects might be.</strong></p>
<p>At current levels, the stock is at 7 times its earnings, has <a href="http://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachHis/Astra_Microwave_Products_Ltd_240713_Rst.pdf">book orders</a> of 1000+ crores <em>"executable in the next 24 to 30 months"</em> and the <a href="http://www.bseindia.com/corporates/Insider_Trading.aspx?scripcd=532493">promoters are buying</a>. Words in the <a href="http://nseindia.com/annual_reports/AR_ASTRAMICRO_2011_2012_03072012103025.zip">annual report (2012)</a> have become more cautious and it does not seem that one might be "overpaying" at these levels. But, I will still like to miss this opportunity and will look for businesses which are lesser dependent on government.</p>
