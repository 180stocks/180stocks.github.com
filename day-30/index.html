    <p>I picked up <a href="http://www.orientsyntex.com/aboutus.php">APM Industries</a> today. It is
available at two times earnings and half the book
value. The market capitalization of the company is
Rs.55 Crores.</p>
<p>Company's profile from <a href="http://www.careratings.com/Portals/0/CareAdmin/CompanyFiles/RR/APM%20INDUSTRIES%20LIMITED%20-02252013.pdf">CARE Report</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>APM was promoted as Ajay Paper Mills Private
Limited in September 1973, by taking over the
partnership business of M/s Prayagdas Kanhaiyalal
&amp; Co. The company had two divisions viz paper
and textile. The paper division was closed down
in 1987.</p>
<p>The name of the company was changed to present
name in April 1990. <strong>The company is engaged in the
manufacturing of synthetic blended yarn</strong>
comprising polyester/viscose, polyester 100%,
acrylic 100% and acrylic/viscose yarn with an
installed capacity of 50,336 spindles as on
March 31, 2012.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Company has a revaluation reserve of Rs.67 Crores
<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. The adjusted net-worth (after removing the
revaluation reserve, i.e. 153 - 67) is Rs.86
crores. It still looks at a substantial discount
to the book value.</p>
<p>In the September 2013 balance sheet, the company's
borrowing have have further reduced to 18 crores
from 25 crores. The company has also declared an
interim dividend of Rs.1 per share. The total
dividend for last 12 months is Rs.2 and provides
a lucrative yield of 8% <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The attractiveness is primarily because of the
increase in earnings over last couple of years.
The revenue has grown from 200 crores in 2010 to
around 300 crores, but the operating profits have
more than doubled and net profits have around
quadrupled. CARE's <a href="http://www.careratings.com/Portals/0/CareAdmin/CompanyFiles/RR/APM%20INDUSTRIES%20LIMITED%20-02272012.pdf">2012 report</a>
provides some insights:</p>
<p><img alt="Increase in the OPM of APM Industries" src="http://180stocks.github.io/static/uploads/apm-opm.png" /></p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if the company is
able to maintain the OPM over 10% in long run.
I believe that the consistency in profits can
reward something big, and the downside looks
limited because of an attractive yield.</p>

<li id="fn:1">
<p>The revaluation was done in 2009 against the
leasehold land (with a remaining lease period of
80 years). Since it is a leasehold land, it might
not be salable and therefore I adjusted the
revaluation amount from the net-worth.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
