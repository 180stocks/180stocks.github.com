    <p>Today I wanted to study <a href="http://www.kcpsugar.com/">KCP Sugars</a>. It
is supposed to be more of a commodity
and cyclical play. But it required too
much data to process and make sense off.
Thus even after collecting many of the
pieces and articles related to KCP
Sugars, I decided to postpone it and end
the day with something simpler.</p>
<p>I screened for companies which had an
average growth of more than 20% in
atleast 5 years in the last decade.
It was an impressive list and most of the
multi-baggers (where PE got re-rated)
were in the list (along with many not-so-good names).
I sorted the list on PE,
excluded large caps and did a quick
scan of initial names.</p>
<p>Most of the companies were government
companies. I skipped over them. Most
others were textile related. One that
did attract a little was <a href="http://www.ganeshaecosphere.com/">Ganesha
Ecosphere</a>. It has an interesting
business of <em>"recycling of post consumer
PET bottle waste into Recycled Poyester
Staple Fibre (RPSF)."</em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ganeshaecosphere.com/annual_reports.html">annual reports</a> were
fairly detailed.  What quickly drove me
away was consistent equity dilution,
promoters pledging, high debt (with
scope for more borrowing in future) and
low tax.</p>
