            <article>
                <p>The company I studied today was <a href="http://www.piindustries.com/">PI Industries Ltd</a>. It was part of the peer comparison in CRISIL's report on Dhanuka Industries which I studied on <a href="http://180stocks.github.io/day-6/">day 6</a>.</p>
<p>The company has issued new shares during each of the last 4 years. Thus it required some efforts to prepare the adjusted net profit figures and to evaluate the issues.</p>
<p><img alt="PI Industries adjusted net profits" src="http://180stocks.github.io/static/uploads/pi-adjusted.png" /></p>
<p>The company has two main verticals. In domestic market it sells the agri-input products (agro-chemicals, fertilizers and plant nutrients), and does the contract research and manufacturing (CRAMS) for its foreign clients.</p>
<p>Last year, the company raised 117 crores through a qualified-institutional-placement (QIP), by issuing the shares at 609.60 (dilution of 8%). The funds being used to setup a new facility at Jambusar SEZ to <em>"provide a fillip to the export volumes."</em></p>
<p>Historically, the company has had an asset-turnover of around 4 times (current net block is of 480 crores). If the capacities are utilized and the company is able to get the export orders, then it can see a turnover of around 2000 crores in a few years (FY 2013's turnover was 1245 crores and FY14Q1 turnover was 400 crores).</p>
<p>The current market capitalization of the company is 1758 crores. Based on the annualized earnings of last quarter, the company is at a forward PE of around 10-12 times.</p>
<p>There isn't a high margin of safety and visibility at these levels, but it is a stock I will keep an eye on.</p>            </article>
