            <article>
                <p>I studied <a href="http://www.premcoglobal.com/">Premco Global Ltd</a> today. It is a manufacturer <em>"of Woven and Knitted Elastic and non-Elastic Narrow Fabric and Webbing (4mm-250mm), and caters to the apparel, lingerie, sports-related, medical, footwear, luggage, furnishing, and automotive industries."</em></p>
<p>This is a hyper competitive market with slow growth and low margins. But the company has posted phenomenal profits during the <a href="http://www.screener.in/company/?q=530331#quarters">last few quarters</a>. The current market capitalization of the company is 8.20 crores, providing a dividend yield of 7% (the company has been consistent with the dividends) and trading at around 1 time its trailing-12-months profits.</p>
<p>I went through the company's annual reports of last few years, but it don't provide much business details. The annual report of 2013 is awaited. Couldn't find the annual reports of <a href="http://www.sky-india.com/about_us.htm">Sky Industries Ltd</a> too, which (claims to be the largest manufacturer in this field).</p>
<p>Keypoints from notes and other reports: The company has 4 plants and the book value is around 3 times the market price. Around 50% of the company's revenues are from exports. The promoters did a small preferential allotment at Rs.28 per share in 2012-13.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that though the high profits have repeated and continued in last 4 quarters, the price has dropped by 20%. Don't know if this was because the stock came under the call-auction mechanism, or because the markets are not expecting the margins to sustain. Either way, even if the margins do not sustain, the company will still be at a PE of 3 with a good dividend track record.</p>
<p>Annual report of 2013 will be something to look forward. How the company utilizes the new profit funds (over 6 crores in last 3 quarters) and how long the margins sustain will be worth digging into. </p>
<p>This <a href="http://libraryequity.blogspot.in/2013/01/premco-global-ltd-elastic-profits.html">detailed blogpost</a> provides some more details.</p>            </article>
