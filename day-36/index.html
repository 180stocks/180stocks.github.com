    <p>I was recently told about <a href="http://www.surya.co.in">Surya Roshni</a>,
primarily due to our PM's push for using LED
bulbs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Surya Roshni started as a small tube making unit
in the year 1973. Today, Surya has emerged as a
vast conglomerate by being the largest in the
steel segment and second largest in the realm of
lighting. Surya has ventured into various other
latitudes of success like fans, cold rolled strips
and PVC pipes etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Company has a market capitalization of 450 Cr (and
a debt of 900 Cr). Average net profits over last
5 years is 57 Cr (and average operating profits of
around 200 Cr). Being a leader in both the
primary segments, steel pipes and lighting, the
earnings are healthy and maintainable <sup id="fnref:icra"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:icra" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h2>What is bad about the company?</h2>
<p>The company has a very low dividend payout. A part
of the reasons is the need for regular plant
upgradation (such as CFL plant in 2010, STIC in
2012, and again a 150 Cr expansion in current
year, probably for LEDs and fans). Over the years,
these huge capital expenditures have contributed
little to shareholders. Until 2008-09, company
used to have an asset turnover of around 5 times,
with operating margins of around 7%. With these
capital expenditures, the asset turnover has
decreased to 3 times, and margins improved
slightly to 8%. Overall, a huge dampner to the
capital employed. Since these expansions needed a
lot of debt, the net profits in the hands of
shareholders have decreased over last 5 years,
even though the operating profits have doubled.</p>
<h2>What I find interesting?</h2>
<p>The income statement of the company has many
fixed-cost line items, primarily interest
expense and depreciation expense. Ben Graham
terms these as "companies with speculative capital
structure." An increase of 15% in operating
profits (which company has usually had) should
cause an increase of 50% in PBT. With the push of
government on LEDs, this <em>can</em> happen.</p>
<p>On the valuations front, the enterprise value of
1350 Crores and market capitalization of 450
Crores is not bad compared to the net block and
the scale of operations <sup id="fnref:net block"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:net block" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. It does provide a cushion
on the down side.</p>
<p>Overall, I might not deploy a high concentration
on the stock and will monitor the biannually
balance sheets to look for debt reduction and
check on further expansions.</p>
