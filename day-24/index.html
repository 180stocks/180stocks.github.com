    <p>Felt a bit tired and wanted to keep it easy today.</p>
<p>Today I picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Uncommon-Profits-Writings-Investment-Classics/dp/0471119288"><em>"Common Stocks and Uncommon
Profits"</em></a>, by Philip A. Fisher, to keep a
pace with both value and growth investing.</p>
<p>On initial reading of the <a href="http://180stocks.github.io/day-22/"><em>"theory of
common-stocks"</em></a> it seemed to be strictly
against the trend/growth investing. But going
through it again hinted that trend and growth
investing are not the same thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The instability of individual companies (in
case of value investing) may
conceivably be offset by means of
thoroughgoing diversification. More-
over, the trend of earnings, although most
dangerous as a <em>sole</em> basis for selection,
may prove a useful <em>indication</em> of investment
merit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The theory also asserts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>that the investor who can success-
fully identify such “growth companies” when
their shares are available at reasonable
prices is certain to do superlatively well
with his capital. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus I thought that it is a proper time to
keep a pace with both the books.</p>
<p>The initial preface of the book provided two
quantitative measures:</p>
<ol>
<li>Above-average sales organization
   (something also seen on <a href="http://180stocks.github.io/day-17/">day 17</a>).</li>
<li>Worth-while profit margin.</li>
</ol>
<p>The second point of "worth-while" profit
margin filtered out few pending companies
from the list: <a href="http://www.hindindustries.net/">Hind Industries</a> and <a href="http://www.uniqueorganics.com/">Unique
Organics</a>. Both have a brilliantly growing
top-line and exports, but the margins have
been terrible (less than 5%).</p>
