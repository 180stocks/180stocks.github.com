<p><a href="http://www.somanyceramics.com/">Somany Ceramics</a> is an interesting
company to evaluate against <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Uncommon-Profits-Writings-Investment-Classics/dp/0471119288">15 point
checklist of Philip Fisher</a>.</p>
<p>The company has been growing amazingly at
over 26% for last 5 years. This has been
largely achieved by incorporating an asset
light model, by outsourcing much of the
manufacturing (50% of the turnover is from
outsourced manufacturing). During the last
couple of years, with the introduction of
digital printing, the <a href="http://www.morbiceramicindustry.com/">unorganized sector</a>
in ceramics has grown at a good pace. Somany
compounded largely on it by getting into
joint-ventures with these unorganized
manufactures, and focusing on sales and
branding. The detailed annual reports hint of
a "fortunate and able" management.</p>
<p>Over the last few years the company has tried
to enter into sanitary-wares too through
their "Aquaware" brand. This has contributed
little to the revenues and profits currently.</p>
<p>On the research front, the company received a
patent for "VC Shield" in 2009. VC Shield has
higher realizations and contributes over 100
crores in the revenues. Apart from this, the
company has been enthusiastic about
introducing latest machines, and pursuing
licences and certifications. During the year
the company as also filed another patent for
slip resistant tiles.</p>
<p>While the revenues have been increasing, the
concerning thing has been the decreasing
margins. The margins have fallen from 10-12%
till 2010 to current 7%. This has been
primarily due to increase in raw-material
costs.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://icra.in/Files/Reports/Rationale/Somany%20Ceramics_r_11072013.pdf">ICRA's report</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[The major concern is the] highly
competitive nature of the tile industry
marked by the presence of both large and
organised players as well as numerous small
scale tile manufacturers, centred largely
around Morbi, which continue to operate with
leaner cost structure. The company’s margins
will be vulnerable to rise in input costs,
especially power and gas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The company is also the net foreign exchange
spender. The last quarter results included
MTM losses of 1.73 crores.</p>
<p>Overall, the company looks very interesting
and will keep a close look on it.</p>
