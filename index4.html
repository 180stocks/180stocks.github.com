            <article>
                <p>Prof.Bakshi shared a very insightful
<a href="https://db.tt/zjwY90Zt">presentation</a> today. While his <a href="http://business.outlookindia.com/article_v3.aspx?artid=285698">earlier
article</a> did discuss about the better returns
in "great businesses", in this new article he
explains why <em>cigar-butt investing doesn't
work</em> and why <em>even at a PE of 25 times, the
valuations are still cheap</em>.</p>
<h2>Main takeaways</h2>
<h3>Two reasons why cigar-butts don't work</h3>
<p><img alt="Say no to cigar butts" src="http://180stocks.github.io/static/uploads/say-no-to-cigar-butts.png" /></p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>In a difficult business, no sooner is one
problem solved than another surfaces -
never is there just one cockroach in the
kitchen. </li>
<li>Time is the friend of the wonderful
business, the enemy of the mediocre. [i.e.
in the low quality business the return on
capital is very low. Thus for each passing
by year where the value doesn't unlock, the
rise in the intrinsic value is only
marginal. While in the case of high quality
businesses, as the return on capital is
high, the intrinsic value nears the high
paid price.]</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The reasons why Graham &amp; Dodd advocated on
"buying cheap" was because of <em>"powerful
<strong>temporary effect</strong> upon all business through
the variations of the economic cycle"</em>
Thus during a temporary shift in the economic
cycle the growth suddenly disappears and the
stocks are beaten down. This is <em>"guarded
against by unvarying insistence upon the
reasonableness of the price paid for each
purchase."</em> [Pg.367 of Security Analysis]</p>
<p>The above is true for most of the businesses.
In-fact the "great businesses" are GREAT
because they rarely witness the <em>"variations
of the economic cycle"</em> as they are
considered to be recession-proof.</p>
<h3>Calculating intrinsic value</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>intrinsic value - the figure indicating what
all of our constituent businesses are
rationally worth. <strong>With perfect foresight,
this number can be calculated by taking all
future cash flows of a business - in and out
- and discounting them at prevailing interest
rates.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Time machine calculation" src="http://180stocks.github.io/static/uploads/time-machine.png" /></p>
<p>This was an interesting learning on how we
can use the concept of DCF for
reverse-engineering. By using the actual
earnings of last few years we can know have
the "perfect foresight" and market
expectations on an historical date.</p>
<p>Another interesting part was about using the
actual discount rates for future calculations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Buffett does not add a risk premium. Instead,
he relies on his single-minded focus on
companies with consistent and predictable
earnings and on the margin of safety that
comes from buying at a substantial discount
in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Graham &amp; Dodd criticised DCF as it involved
<em>"<strong>assuming</strong> certain vital facts about
future earnings, distribution policy and
interest rates"</em> [Pg.364 of the Security
Analysis]</p>
<h3>What are great businesses</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Companies that have a established track
record of delivering high owner earnings in
relation to capital.</p>
<p>Projects where profitability is high and
overwhelmingly likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Businesses that have enduring competitive
advantages backed by demonstrated
consistent earning power, and it
so happens that those types of businesses
happen to be concentrated in sectors having
persistent CFROI's.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Graham &amp; Dodd too appreciated the results of
successful growth investing. But they
maintained that <em>"identification of
growth company is not so simple a matter as
it may appear. It cannot be accomplished
solely by an examination of the statistics
and records but requires a considerable
supplement of special investigation and of
business judgement... the real question is
whether or not <strong>all</strong> careful and
intelligent investors can follow this policy
with fair success."</em></p>
<p>Graham and Dodd classified the companies as
great companies which <em>"participage in
general record of growth so that they combine
the advantages of a long period of upbuilding
and an <strong>exceptional</strong> ability to expand
later."</em></p>
<p>On the stock front, I wasn't able to study
any new stocks but the ones that were
mentioned in the <a href="https://db.tt/zjwY90Zt">presentation</a> itself.</p>            </article>
