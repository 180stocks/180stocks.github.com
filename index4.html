            <article>
                <p>I ran a screen for companies with low price to
average earnings of last 5 years. <a href="http://www.aptech-worldwide.com/">Aptech Ltd.</a>
attracted me because of a high dividend yield (over 7%)
and some known brand name.</p>
<h3>Business</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Aptech has two main streams of
businesses – Individual training and Enterprise
Business.</p>
<p>Under Individual Training, Aptech offers career
and professional training through its Aptech
Computer Education, Arena Animation &amp; Maya
Academy of Advanced Cinematics (both in
Animation &amp; Multimedia), Aptech Hardware &amp;
Networking Academy, Aptech Aviation &amp;
Hospitality Academy and Aptech English Learning
Academy brands.</p>
<p>Enterprise business includes Content Development
(Aptech Learning Services), Training and
Assessment Solutions for Corporates &amp;
Institutions (Aptech Training Solutions, Aptech
Assessment &amp; Testing Solutions).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As per the last <a href="http://www.aptech-worldwide.com/downloads/investorrelations_financials/quarter-results/2013/APTECH_LIMITED_Investor_Update_Q3_FY_2013_14.pdf">investor's presentation</a>,
the enterprise business contributes around 20% of
the revenue.</p>
<p>The business of computer education looks
attractive to me. Most of the company's revenue
come from animation and computer education
courses. Unlike specialized coaching centers for
competitive exams, these courses are more
methodological and <em>do not</em> depend on the
specialization of a particular local teacher. The
company prepares the educational content and
provides it to its franchisees for a royalty. This
is more of a fixed cost and does not increase in
proportion to the revenues. This is evident from
an increase in the margins over the years as the
company has entered new geographies.</p>
<p>For students, though the company does not provide
a degree, the certificates provided matter more
than the certificates from local computer
institutes because of a better visibility of the
"Aptech" brand.</p>
<p>I wanted to understand why other education
businesses including Educomp failed. <a href="http://forbesindia.com/article/real-issue/the-rise-and-fall-of-educomp/34993/1">This Forbes
article</a> provided a hint for that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The risk is that this technology sales model
becomes akin to the sub-prime mortgage scenario
that caused the credit crisis in the US. Like in
the US where loans were given to people who did
not have the repayment capacity, <strong>there is some
danger that ambitious schools looking for a
magic bullet are buying hardware and software
they ultimately can’t afford,</strong>” says Karan
Khemka, a partner with Parthenon, a strategic
advisory firm with a special focus on education.</p>
<p>“<strong>It is the job of a financing institution, not
an educational services vendor, to finance a
school. Otherwise you end up bearing business
risk, execution risk and financing risk.</strong> That’s
too much to bear,”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above risk looks low because Aptech maintains
an asset light balance-sheet and carries no debt.</p>
<h3>Financial overview</h3>
<p>Recently, Aptech started paying dividends and has
increased the interim dividends from Rs.1.5 to
Rs.2.5 per share.</p>
<p>The company also <a href="http://www.aptech-worldwide.com//downloads/shares/Aptech-buyback-of-share-23jan2014.pdf">bought-back shares</a> worth
88,97,861 at average Rs.67 during the last
financial year.</p>
<pre>
Market cap (3.989 cr sh. @ 74):      295.18 Crores.
Total Tangible Assets (2014):        266.15 Crores.

5 Year Average Earnings (PBT):        37.61 Crores.
Yield:                                12.74%
Yield on Max Earnings:                24.73%

CMP:                                  74.00
EPS:                                   6.35
Dividend per share (interim):          4.50
(final dividend is awaited)
</pre>

<h3>Speculative side</h3>
<p>Company has 110.84 Crores in a private investment
in China. Till 2009, the investment was a joint
venture, as a result its profits were consolidated in
Aptech's results. Since 2010, Aptech exchanged the
50% stake in the joint venture for a 22.40% stake
in the venture's holding company. Financial
details about the company are not available. This
investment now only receives periodic dividends
<sup id="fnref:dividends"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:dividends" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Overall Aptech has an speculative appeal with a
limited downside (due to an attractive dividend
yield and a consistent business). If the company
is able to maintain the growth trend and keep up
the dividend payouts, the stock can easily double
from here over 3 years. A surprise dividend from
the China investment can also provide a good
upside.</p>
