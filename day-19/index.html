    <p>Today I began with the <em>"Theory of
Common-Stock Investment"</em> from the
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Security-Analysis-Edition-Foreword-Editions/dp/0071592539">Security Analysis</a>
book. I always related Graham only with
deep-value/distressed/liquidation
investing, but in this chapter Graham
discusses and compares about the growth/trend
investing too.</p>
<p>The chapter defines [value] investments as
the ones which have:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>a suitable and established dividend return,</li>
<li>a stable and adequate earnings record, and</li>
<li>a satisfactory backing of tangible assets.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>In growth/trend investing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two of the three elements above stated
lost nearly all their significance,
and the third, the earnings record,
took on an entirely novel complexion.
The new theory or principle may be
summed up in the sentence: “The value
of a common stock depends entirely
upon what it will earn in the future.”
From this dictum the following corollaries were drawn:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>That the dividend rate should have
slight bearing upon the value. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That since no relationship apparently
existed between assets and
earning power, the asset value was
entirely devoid of importance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That past earnings were significant
only to the extent that they indicated
what changes in the earnings were
likely to take place in the future.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Graham even says that it was a <em>"sound
premise used to support an unsound
conclusion."</em> The prices rise <em>"for the
simple reason that common-stocks earned
more than they paid out in dividends and
thus the reinvested earnings added to
their worth."</em></p>
<p>Thus the trend/growth theory is
attractive as long as <em>"common-stocks
earned more than the bond-interest rate
upon their cost. This would be true,
typically, of a stock earning $10 and
selling at 100."</em> The moment we start
paying 20-40 times earnings, the
<em>"earning power is no greater than the bond-inter-
est rate, without the extra protection
afforded by a prior claim."</em> The analysis
of the balance sheet and earnings is
still stressed upon.</p>

<p>One company that looks close to the
concepts of "investing" is <a href="http://www.occlindia.com/">Oriental
Carbon &amp; Chemicals</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The company provides a dividend yield
of 5% (and more than 4% yield for each
of the last 4 years dividends). Thus the
company has <em>"suitable and established"</em>
dividend return.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 10 years average earnings have
been 14.54 crores and 5 years average
earnings have been stable at 25 crores <sup id="fnref:Disc"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:Disc" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> .
On the market capitalization of 98
crores the earnings are adequate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Market capitalization is almost half of the
net-worth of 170 crores. Thus there is a
satisfactory backing of tangible assets.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Due to paucity of time I was not able
to make adjustments of "economic
earnings" for each year. On the balance
sheet too I only made the obvious
adjustments.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:Disc" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
