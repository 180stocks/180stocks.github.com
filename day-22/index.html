    <p>Today I continued with the
<em>"Theory of Common-Stock Investment"</em> from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Security-Analysis-Edition-Foreword-Editions/dp/0071592539">Security Analysis</a>.
The thing that striked me the most was this
passage:</p>
<p><img alt="Investing in de-growth businesses" src="http://180stocks.github.io/uploads/degrowth.png" /></p>
<p>My aim for the day was to find one such
company which is <em>"long established, well
financed, important in its industry and
presumably destined to stay in business and
make profits indefinitely in the future, but
that have no speculative or growth appeal"</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.tatasponge.com/">Tata Sponge</a> seemed to fit well into that
definition. The company has an average
earnings of Rs.70 crores over last decade and
the <strong>market capitalization is Rs.450
crores</strong>. The net-worth is 640 crores.</p>
<p>Off this net-worth of 640 crores, <strong>Rs.361
crores is in fixed deposits and investments</strong>.
Thus funds used in operations are around 278
crores (with 161 crores of depreciated fixed
assets) <sup id="fnref:idle funds"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:idle funds" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> .</p>
<p>Over last few years, the operating margins of
the company have reduced from 30% levels to
current 13% levels. This has been mainly
because of the high raw-material prices (58%
of cost in 2008 vs 75% of cost in 2013).</p>
<p><img alt="Tata Sponge Quantitative Data" src="http://180stocks.github.io/uploads/tata-sponge-data.png" /></p>
<p>From the above volume data it doesn't look
that the company is going through a
permanent bad phase. The down-swing looks
purely cyclical, though it is hard to
estimate how long it can continue.</p>
<p>Overall it does look like a company where
there has been no recent growth, and the
valuations have depressed for this reason.</p>
<p><strong>Some concerns:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What kind of upside are we looking for in
   such cases (i.e. what is the good selling
   point)? (I would give the intrisic value
   of around 600 crores based on 3 kilns and
   the cash, though much will depend on how
   the company goes on to deploy this cash).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How long can it take to unlock the value
   (or rather how long can the depressed
   cycles continue)?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I guess the answers to the above too must be
somewhere in this excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Security-Analysis-Edition-Foreword-Editions/dp/0071592539">book</a>.</p>
