    <p>I continued with my search for companies available
at low market capitalization to average earnings
of last 10 years. A couple of interesting names
sprang up: <a href="http://www.screener.in/company/?q=500300&amp;con=1">Grasim Industries</a> and <a href="http://www.screener.in/company/?q=532240">India Nippon</a>.</p>
<p>Grasim Industries looked specifically interesting
based on the consistent consolidated earnings.
Interestingly, the company has a 60% stake in
UltraTech Cement. This alone values to 38,593
crores. The current market capitalization of
Grasim is 27,839 crores. It was the low dividend
payout, complexity of balance sheet (due to
various businesses and subsidiaries) and a
<a href="https://db.tt/ctpiLsx4">prejudice against the promoters</a> that
drove me away.</p>
<hr />
<p>Another interesting name was <a href="http://www.indianippon.com/">India Nippon
Electricals</a> <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>India Nippon is a joint venture between Lucas
Indian Service Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Lucas-TVS Ltd and Kokusan Denki Co. Ltd, Japan - a
group company of Hitachi Japan, to <strong>manufacture
Electronic Ignition Systems for two-wheelers,
three wheelers and portable engines.</strong> Over the
years the company has enlarged its customer base
and now supplies to most of the manufacturers of
two-wheelers, three wheelers and gensets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The company has a better dividend payout and a
stream of consistent earnings. The stock has a
decent dividend yield of 4.21%, but nothing
attractive beyond that. The profits have remained
the same over 10 years, the return on equity has
been low at ~14% (due to large amount of
investments) and the valuations look fair at
the market capitalization of 240 crores.</p>
<p>Will give both of the above a skip.</p>

<p>The company has nothing to do with 'Nippo'
the popular battery brand. That is a different
listed company called <a href="http://www.nippobatteries.com">Indo-National Ltd.</a>&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
