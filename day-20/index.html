    <p>Have been stuck with fever and thus would 
keep it short today.</p>
<p>One of the companies which attracted me recently
was <a href="http://www.screener.in/company/?q=524731">Jenburkt Pharma</a>. The company has a brilliant
dividend yield of 6.25% and a consistent dividend
record.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jenburkt is engaged in manufacturing and
marketing of speciality and high quality
pharmaceutical formulations and healthcare products.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To come-up with some valuation, I took the
last year's dividend and compounded it at
historical growth rate.</p>
<p>The last year dividend was Rs.4.20.
Required rate of return: 20%.
Lowest historical growth rate of profits:
17%.</p>
<p>Thus I came up with a value of 4.20 * 100 /
(20-17) = 140. At current price of 66 it
looked quite attractive.</p>
<p><strong>The above was all wrong.</strong></p>
<p>There was a good <a href="http://www.valuepickr.com/forum/not-so-hidden-gems/577662220">discussion</a> about the company
and its products. It seems the company's
products have a tremendous competition.
Probably the strength lies in the company's
distribution network or sales team. Over the
years these hasn't been much sales growth
(just 13% in 10 years). But the OPM margins
have shown a consistent up-trend (increased
from 7% to current 15%).</p>
<p>If there was one thing that had a real impact
from <a href="http://180stocks.github.io/day-19/">yesterday's post</a>, then it was to take
average earnings for the calculations. If we
take the average earnings, then the
valuations no longer look too attractive and
the dividends growth rate looks improbable.</p>
<p>In last 4 annual reports the management has
been talking about growth opportunities but
the same haven't translated much in the
financials.</p>
