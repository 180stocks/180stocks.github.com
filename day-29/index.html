    <p>Today I studied <a href="http://www.tcil.com/tcil/">Transport Corporation of
India</a> (TCIL). It attracted as a <a href="http://180stocks.github.io/uploads/degrowth.png">"Graham and
Dodd"</a> kind of idea.</p>
<p>About TCIL from <a href="http://crisil.com/Ratings/RatingList/RatingDocs/TransportCorporationofIndiaLimited_080713.html">CRISIL's report</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TCIL is among the leading integrated logistic
service providers in India and the only
player in India’s logistics industry to offer
the entire range of services, such as
multi-mode transportation services comprising
road, rail, sea, and air transportation. Its
business risk profile is also supported by a
strong infrastructure backbone and relevant
partnerships in the logistics sector.
Furthermore, with operations across four key
logistic segments: freight, express cargo
(XPS),supply chain solutions (SCS), and
coastal shipping, TCIL’s revenue profile is
fairly diversified. In 2012-13 (refers to
financial year, April 1 to March 31) freight,
XPS, SCS and coastal shipping contributed 40
per cent, 28 per cent, 26 per cent and 5 per
cent, respectively, to TCIL’s overall
revenues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The market capitalization of the company is
around 370 Crores against the book net-worth
of 405 Crores. The company witnessed a
revenue growth of around 20% each year from
2003 to 2007; followed by a moderate growth
till 2011; and a nominal growth during the
last two years. Following a similar trend,
the price to book value went upto 4 times
during the period of growth. It is after 
10 years that the stock has gone below its
book value.</p>
<p>I began with the analysis of the net-worth
and assets. Reserves included a revaluation
reserve of 14 crores on the face. But in
2008, 41 crores was transferred from
revaluation reserve to other capital reserve
directly. Thus the total revaluation reserve
comes to 55 crores. Company has book
investments of 33 crores, of which around 20
crores has been invested in subsidiaries. For
arriving at an estimate economic net-worth, I
reduced this amount too. Thus economic
net-worth comes to around 330 crores.</p>
<p>On the interesting side, the share of higher
margin divisions (XPS and SCS) has been
increasing over the last couple of years.
With the economic turnaround and growth in
freight division, the stock can provide good
returns.</p>
<p>Sticking to the book rules, I will keep an
eye on the stock and re-evaluate if the
capitalization falls another 15-20% from
here. Till then I feel <a href="http://180stocks.github.io/day-23/">KCP Sugar</a> and
<a href="http://180stocks.github.io/day-22/">Tata Sponge</a> remain a better
alternative.</p>
