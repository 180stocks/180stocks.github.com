<article>
    <p>One of my friends recently mentioned about
<a href="http://www.vardhmanacrylics.com/">Vardhman Acrylics</a>. The company
manufactures Acrylic Fibre (AF) - a sort of
commodity product, but with <a href="http://www.nseindia.com/content/corporate/eq_VARDHACRLC_base.pdf">only 5 major
manufacturers</a> in India. What attracted me
about the company were its valuations.</p>
<p>The company earns a recurring <em>interest income</em> of
around 6 Crores. The average <em>operating profits</em>
(i.e.  excluding income from investments) of the
company over last 5 years have been 39 Crores
(after depreciation, but before tax).</p>
<p>For a moment, lets ignore all the investments on
balance sheet (of over 200 Crores) and just
compound the above two revenue streams:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">Interest</span> <span class="n">income</span><span class="o">:</span>  <span class="mi">6</span> <span class="n">Crores</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="n">X</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">60</span> <span class="n">Crores</span>
<span class="n">Operating</span> <span class="n">income</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">39</span> <span class="n">Crores</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="n">X</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">320</span> <span class="n">Crores</span>
<span class="o">----------------------------------------------</span>
<span class="n">TOTAL</span> <span class="n">VALUE</span><span class="o">:</span>    <span class="mi">380</span> <span class="n">Crores</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The company currently has a <strong>market
capitalization of Rs.197 Crores</strong> and is almost
debt free. It looks a fifty-cent-dollar-bill
based on both the earnings as well as balance sheet.</p>
<h2>Catches</h2>
<p>The biggest problem with the company is that it
has never paid dividends. <strong>Over last 5 years, the
company has earned over 170 Crores. Neither of
these profits have been distributed as dividends,
nor redeployed into the business. All of it has
been invested into bonds and mutual funds.</strong> As per
the <a href="http://nseindia.com/corporate/VARDHACRLC_30Sep2014_S.zip">latest balance sheet</a>, the company
has over 233 Crores of investments. The most
stressing point of Graham has been on dividends.
Rarely have the companies rewarded the investors
by retaining the profits with themselves.</p>
<p>Another point of concern might be the high value
of related party transactions. The company is
promoted by Vardhman Textiles, which holds ~75% of
company's equity. Around 50% of the sale (255
Crores of the total sales of 510 Crores) is made
to this holding company - Vardhman Textiles.
Though it is risky from the pricing point of view,
it assures the company of 50% of its current
sales. The pricing of the sales appears to be
unbaised.</p>
<h2>Triggers and Developments</h2>
<p>Few developments which make the stock interesting
are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recent buy-backs:</strong> The company has bought
  back around 1.55 crore shares @11.50. With the
  increasing interest income and decreasing number
  of outstanding shares, the EPS should increase
  going forward.</li>
<li><strong>Stability in exchange rates:</strong> Since 2011-12, the
  company has been incurring an average 4 Crores of
  exchange fluctuation losses on ACN import. This
  can normalize going forward.</li>
<li><strong>Promoter buying:</strong> Vardhman Textiles has been
  consistently increase its stake in the company
  over the years. After the recent buy-backs, I
  wish and hope for a maiden dividend in future.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="http://nseindia.com/corporate/VARDHACRLC_30Sep2014_S.zip">recent quarterly results</a> have not
shown the interest income in other income. I will
try to get more info around it. Over all it is a
very interesting stock to track.</p>
