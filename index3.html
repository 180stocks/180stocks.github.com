            <article>
                <p>Today I began with <a href="http://www.screener.in/screens/3750/Good%20ROCE/">screening</a> for
companies having good return on capital,
providing decent interest coverage ratio
and paying out dividends.</p>
<p>One of the interesting companies that
came up was <a href="http://www.viratindustries.com/">Virat Industries</a>.
I specifically liked the detailed annual
reports and the business details the
company provided <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> . On the fundamental
side, the stock provides a good dividend
yield of 6%. The company is debt-free,
has 1.5 crores of cash (against a market
capitalization of 11.76 crores), decent
return ratios and a consistent
performance record <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> .</p>
<p>At the PE of 4.5 and price near the book
value, the stock surely looked very
attractive (the <a href="http://www.bseindia.com/corporates/Sharehold_Search.aspx?code=530521">promoters</a> too have been
buying small quantities). I went on to
discuss the company with an expert.</p>
<p><img alt="About Virat Industries" src="http://180stocks.github.io/static/uploads/virat.png" /></p>
<p>I was asked to compare the company with <a href="http://www.screener.in/company/?q=526851#pl">Arex
Industries</a> and <a href="http://180stocks.github.io/day-12/">Premco Global</a>. Arex 
has amazing operating cashflows (more
than the company's market capitalization
for each of the last 4 years).</p>
<p>The problem with these companies is not
the operations or valuations, but the
scale of opportunities. These business
are too competitive in nature (due to a
commodity product) and it is
hard to scale their turnover beyond a
size. In textile, this is further
compounded due to competition from
Bangladesh and China.</p>
<p>He explained that if we are going into
small-caps, then we should look for
superior returns. Look for businesses
which have potential of growing at more
than 20% year-on-year due to the
advantage of their small size. Otherwise
we are only aiming at average returns,
which can be obtained from safer
large-cap stocks too.</p>
<p>This surely clicked to me. Their might
be some mis-pricing in these stocks, but
that reminds me of the <a href="http://ycombinator.com/munger.html">essay by Charlie
Munger</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the long term, it's hard for a
stock to earn a much better return
than the business which underlies it
earns. If the business earns 6% on
capital over 40 years and you hold it
for that 40 years, you're not going to
make much different than a 6%
return—even if you originally buy it
at a huge discount. Conversely, if a
business earns 18% on capital over 20
or 30 years, even if you pay an
expensive looking price, you'll end up
with a fine result.</p>
<p>So the trick is getting into better
businesses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over last decade, Virat's stock has
given modest 15% returns, and Arex stock has gone
nowhere in the last 5 years, both inline
with their businesses performances.</p>
