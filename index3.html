            <article>
                <p><a href="http://acrysil.com/">Acrysil</a> is a small-cap company with market capitalization of only 53 crores. The company makes quartz kitchen sinks and says that <em>"we are the only company in all of Asia - and one of just a few companies worldwide – manufacturing quartz kitchen sinks to global standards of quality, durability and visual appeal. We have no competition in its class in India."</em></p>
<p>~80% of the revenues of the company comes from exports. Till 2011, the company had good margins of more than 20%. Over last few years the gross margins declined to 16% and coupled with higher interest costs, the bottom-line shrinked (even though revenues had a moderate growth).</p>
<p>Recently the company posted a very good <a href="http://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachHis/Acrysil_Ltd_290713_Rst.pdf">June quarter</a> and that got me interested into the stock. The company has had a good revenue growth and improvement in the margins can reward big. The management seems pretty ambitious about the growth in the <a href="http://www.bseindia.com/bseplus/annualreport/524091/5240910313.pdf">annual reports</a>.</p>
<p>I would tag the stock as a risky bet but with good potential rewards. The things which I find very risky are:</p>
<p><strong>The ambitious future plans</strong>: Company aims to be the "undisputed ‘No 1’ position – the top-most one-stop brand for every requirement in kitchen products – every fitting, accessory, appliance and utility."</p>
<p>For this, the company plans "to further increase domestic sales by launching new models, catering to new projects and aggressive promotion."</p>
<p><strong>Weak financials</strong>: The cash-flows are relatively weak with around 70% realisation of the operating profits over last 5 years. The tax payout is also relative low at 20%.</p>
<p><strong>Other things</strong>: The company has 4 subsidiaries (with a couple of them in losses). The company does not post the consolidated results on the quarterly basis. I also found the managerial remuneration to be on a higher side (20% of the net-profits). In 2008 the company came up with a preferential allotment to promoters and diluted 15% of the stake of the other shareholders.</p>
<p>With the kinds of ambitions and historical growth, the company does look interesting. The new lines of products and new-brand building can take some time to break-even and thus I will keep a close eye on the margins and debt levels in the upcoming quarters.</p>            </article>
