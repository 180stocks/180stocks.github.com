    <p>I continued with Philip Fisher's 15 point
checklist today.</p>
<p>The first point is <em>"potential to make
possible a sizable increase in sales."</em>
Fisher suggests finding companies which have
been growing in past. For this he recommends
to check for growth in blocks (and not on
year-on-year basis).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>growth should not be judged on annual basis
but, say, by taking units of several years
each.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I took the 9 years historical data and
computed a <a href="http://180stocks.github.io/uploads/growth.xlsx">list of companies</a> having sales
growth of over 20% in the blocks of 3 years
each. I filtered the list to restrict
the stocks upto PE of 15 and debt to equity
ratios of less than 0.75.</p>
<p>Browsed through the annual reports of few of
them, but in most cases it was some one-off
item. Few names that looked interesting are <a href="http://www.somanyceramics.com/">Somany
Ceramics</a> and <a href="http://www.globusspirits.com/">Global Spirits</a>.</p>
<p>Will try to look at these and few other names
over the next few days.</p>
