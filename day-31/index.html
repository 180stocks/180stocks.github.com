    <p>Chapter 29 of <a href="www.amazon.com/Security-Analysis-Edition-Foreword-Editions/dp/0071592539">Security Analysis</a> talks about
dividend payouts. After reading the chapter, I was
set to find <a href="http://www.screener.in/screens/new/?query=Average+dividend+payout+3years+%3E+50+AND%0D%0APrice+to+Earning+%3E+0&amp;sort=Price+to+Earning&amp;order=asc">companies with more than 50% dividend
payouts</a>. One of the interesting names
that came up was <a href="http://kotharipetrochemicals.com">Kothari Petrochemicals</a>.</p>
<p><em>Company's brief from <a href="http://www.icra.in/Files/Reports/Rationale/Kothari%20Petrochemicals%20Limited-r-17022012.pdf">ICRA's report</a>:</em>
<img alt="About Kothari Petrochemicals" src="http://180stocks.github.io/static/uploads/kpl-profile.png" /></p>
<p>At the current market cap of ~50 crores, the
company provides a dividend yield of 9%. Recent
quarters have been much better than last year (net
profit of 11 crores during trailing 12 months vs
5.21 crores during FY2013.) Thus if the company
maintains the payout ratio of over 50%, then the
resulting yield will be attractively over 10%.</p>
<p>On the business end, not much history is
available. The margins in the business are very
low (~5%), and the annual report isn't much
optimistic either. The return on capital employed
has staggered due to the increases in the fixed assets
<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>On the valuation front, the stock looks very
interesting (primarily due to the seductive
dividend yield). What the company ends up doing
with the year's profits should determine the fate
of the stock. If the company distributes the
profits as dividends, it will improve the
credibility and trust in the management. And if
the company invests the profits in the un-required
fixed assets (as it did in 2011-12), then the
markets will probably label the management as
crooked.</p>

<li id="fn:1">
<p>The company increased fixed assets by 27
crores in 2012. Around 14 crores was for a
"building on lease" (which gets a rent of 1.23
crores) and 13 crores was for a windmill. The
windmill was disposed off in 2013 for 9 crores.
The net loss seems to be around 2 crores (after
depreciation) charged to income and loss account
in 2013.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
