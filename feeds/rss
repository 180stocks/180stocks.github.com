The stock looked interesting as it was showing a very good year-on-year growth and yet available at multi-year low (at a market capitalization of 276 crores).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began reading the company's 2006 annual report. It was an exceptional year as the company's top-line grew by over 50%. Net profit that year was of 37 crores (and has stayed below it until 2013). That year company declared a 1:1 bonus (along with a stock split in 5:1 ratio). The R&amp;amp;D expenditure was 18% of revenue and the annual report was pretty optimistic about the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="From 2006 Annual Report" src="http://180stocks.github.io/static/uploads/astra_microwave.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at the &lt;a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/stock-charts/astramicrowaveproducts/charts/AMP01#AMP01"&gt;historical price&lt;/a&gt; chart to find that the market had been even more optimistic and had valued the company at whooping 1000 crores (37 times its annual earnings).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year, company reported the &lt;em&gt;"end of major production orders of ground based radar sub-system which dominated both the top line and bottom line growth of the company in the last two financial years."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson of the day was never to overpay for a stock, no matter how tempting the prospects might be.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At current levels, the stock is at 7 times its earnings, has &lt;a href="http://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachHis/Astra_Microwave_Products_Ltd_240713_Rst.pdf"&gt;book orders&lt;/a&gt; of 1000+ crores &lt;em&gt;"executable in the next 24 to 30 months"&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.bseindia.com/corporates/Insider_Trading.aspx?scripcd=532493"&gt;promoters are buying&lt;/a&gt;. Words in the &lt;a href="http://nseindia.com/annual_reports/AR_ASTRAMICRO_2011_2012_03072012103025.zip"&gt;annual report (2012)&lt;/a&gt; have become more cautious and it does not seem that one might be "overpaying" at these levels. But, I will still like to miss this opportunity and will look for businesses which are lesser dependent on government.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Pratyush</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>tag:180stocks.github.io,2013-08-01:day-4/</guid></item><item><title>Day 3</title><link>http://180stocks.github.io/day-3/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Today I started with &lt;a href="http://www.screener.in/company/?q=504966"&gt;Tinplate Company of India Ltd&lt;/a&gt;. It is a &lt;strong&gt;Tata Enterprise&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;"largest indigenous producer of tin coated and tin free steel sheets in India"&lt;/em&gt;. The company has been in the business for over 90 years. Yet the &lt;strong&gt;market capitalization is only 358 crores&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a coincidence that today only I got a copy of the latest &lt;a href="http://www.capitalmarket.com/magazine/contents.asp?volno=28&amp;amp;Issno=11"&gt;Capital Market magazine&lt;/a&gt;. The cover story is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;"small forever."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The article covers the case-studies of &lt;a href="http://www.screener.in/company/?q=506685"&gt;Ultramarine &amp;amp; Pigments&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.screener.in/company/?q=509820"&gt;Paper Products Ltd&lt;/a&gt;. Both the companies have been into their business for decades, and yet have failed to scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case of Ultramarine, &lt;em&gt;"though the company has reported profit over the last one decade; out of last 10 years, it reported decline in profit in five years."&lt;/em&gt; The reason associated is &lt;em&gt;"over-dependence on few clients."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paper Products has multiple big FMCG clients including Levers, Nestle, Cadbury, Coca Cola etc. Yet the company hasn't been able to scale as it &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;"is sandwiched between big customers on one hand and is a commodity play on the other hand."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to see that in both of the above cases, the companies were in a sort of commodity business and that their clients were big corporations. Thus the other party got to dictate the terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming back to Tinplate Company, tinplate is widely used in packaging industry. Infact 55% of the domestic demand is met through imports. But it is the other substitutes (tetra pack, pet, plastics as well as non-prime tin) that pose a major substitution threat due to their cost competitiveness. It is very similar to the above two cases of commodities and big customers. There is some hope for good growth in top-line but the growth in bottom-line looks doubtful. Valuations too don't look too cheap to provide a good margin of safety at these levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://180stocks.github.io/day-2/"&gt;Yesterday&lt;/a&gt; I also talked about &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.screener.in/company/?q=532493"&gt;Astra Microwave&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; while studying defense stocks. Well, I will need to delay it again for tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Pratyush</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>tag:180stocks.github.io,2013-07-31:day-3/</guid></item><item><title>Day 2</title><link>http://180stocks.github.io/day-2/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;One of my friends is in army and wants to invest into stocks. While talking to him over phone, I started looking at the listed companies into defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began with &lt;a href="http://www.screener.in/company/?q=533339"&gt;Zen Technologies&lt;/a&gt;. The company manufactures simulators and has a market capitalization of only 60 crores. The earnings have been very volatile over the years (63 crores in 2009 vs 17 crores in 2011 vs 100 crores in 2012 vs 40 crores in 2013). The company has an order book of &lt;a href="http://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachHis/ZEN_Technologies_Ltd_300513_Rst.pdf"&gt;37 crores&lt;/a&gt; and an OPM of around 30% (also very volatile). Company's recent buy back did bring some excitement, but it was a minor quantity of 17000 shares (0.19%). Due to the volatility in earnings of the company, I found it hard to derive some valuations for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bseindia.com/download/Research_Report/Report/533339/2012-13/BSE%20Company%20Research%20Report%20-%20Zen%20Technologies%20Ltd.pdf"&gt;CARE's report&lt;/a&gt; on Zen Technology mentioned about Bharat Electronics among the listed peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Electronics"&gt;Bharat Electronics&lt;/a&gt; is a PSU. It &lt;em&gt;"primarily manufactures advanced electronic products for the Indian Armed Forces."&lt;/em&gt; Market cap is just around 9000 crores with a cash of around 5000 crores in the March'13 &lt;a href="http://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachHis/Bharat_Electronics_Ltd_300513.pdf"&gt;balance sheet&lt;/a&gt;. The annual profits are around 900 crores. This makes it a very attractive stock to follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the risk here, as is with all the other PSUs, is that there are elections within the next 12 months. The experts believe that the cash from balance sheets of the PSUs will suddenly disappear. Some unnecessary deal, merger, expansion, subsidiary etc will happen and the cash will be gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barring the last year, the sales growth have been slow in the company. There are risks about the cash management, and a large distrust in promoters. For these reasons, I will watch this stock from a distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.screener.in/company/?q=532493"&gt;Astra Microwave&lt;/a&gt; looked good among other peers. I will cover it tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Pratyush</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>tag:180stocks.github.io,2013-07-30:day-2/</guid></item><item><title>Day 1</title><link>http://180stocks.github.io/day-1/</link><description>&lt;h2&gt;What is this about?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://jenniferdewalt.com/index.html"&gt;Jennifer&lt;/a&gt; wanted to master web-development in 180 days. The way she proceeded was to build 1 website each day. That is crazy, and the &lt;a href="http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com/"&gt;results are fabulous&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to try the same craziness on stocks. Over the next half year, I will try to learn more about investing concepts, businesses and industries. Each day I will try to study at least 1 company and write a brief post about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 1:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked up &lt;a href="http://www.screener.in/company/?q=532899"&gt;Kaveri Seeds&lt;/a&gt; for today. It is a seasonal company and its results are due within a week or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has an excellent business. It provides high quality hybrid seeds which increases the crop's yield. In 2008, it introduced revolutionary hybrid BT-Cotton seeds, which provided wonderful returns not only to the farmers but also to the shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="http://www.kaveriseeds.in/AR-06-07.pdf"&gt;2007 annual report&lt;/a&gt; company mentioned that &lt;em&gt;"once a hybrid seed is developed and introduced, its acceptability gradually declines from year to year."&lt;/em&gt; Five years later, in the 2012 annual report it says &lt;em&gt;"cotton, considered by many as a mature market, we expect to gain market share because of our differentiated and high-yielding hybrid seeds portfolio."&lt;/em&gt; At the same time the company is optimistic about the developments in hybrid rice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The balance sheet of the company is one of the most amazing ones. &lt;strong&gt;Of the total 858 crores of assets, 253 crores is financed from advance from customers. Another 237 crores is financed from creditors.&lt;/strong&gt; June quarter is the most important quarter for the company and thus the closing stock from March balance sheet gives a good estimate about the upcoming results. The March'13 inventory is Rs.491 crores (against 303 crores previous year). Going by these and the good monsoons, I estimate June sales to grow by anything between 30% to 75%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the above numbers, the forward PE is of around 9 to 12 times. At current PE of 16 (market cap of 2131 crores), it seems that the market has already discounted this upcoming quarter's growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that makes me concerned is that the company's annual report does not talk much about the business process. For a 2000 crore company, I expected the details about how the company's seeds are better and the differences in yields (some statistical and quantitative data). I also expected more details about the reasons for the robust growths (i.e whether the company expanded in new states or was it some real yield magic). Another little danger area is of lower taxation. This is one area where the peers (I checked Bayer Cropscience) seem more transparent about the processes and paying higher taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is enough &lt;a href="http://www.valuepickr.com/forum/not-so-hidden-gems/608487840"&gt;ground work homework&lt;/a&gt; available and I will take a little time to go through it. As it is a start, I find it hard to derive some intrinsic value for the company and thus will pick up a little smaller company for the next update.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Pratyush</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>tag:180stocks.github.io,2013-07-29:day-1/</guid></item></channel></rss>
