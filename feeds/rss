&lt;p&gt;Today I picked up &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Uncommon-Profits-Writings-Investment-Classics/dp/0471119288"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Common Stocks and Uncommon
Profits"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Philip A. Fisher, to keep a
pace with both value and growth investing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On initial reading of the &lt;a href="http://180stocks.github.io/day-22/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"theory of
common-stocks"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; it seemed to be strictly
against the trend/growth investing. But going
through it again hinted that trend and growth
investing are not the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instability of individual companies (in
case of value investing) may
conceivably be offset by means of
thoroughgoing diversification. More-
over, the trend of earnings, although most
dangerous as a &lt;em&gt;sole&lt;/em&gt; basis for selection,
may prove a useful &lt;em&gt;indication&lt;/em&gt; of investment
merit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theory also asserts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that the investor who can success-
fully identify such “growth companies” when
their shares are available at reasonable
prices is certain to do superlatively well
with his capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus I thought that it is a proper time to
keep a pace with both the books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial preface of the book provided two
quantitative measures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Above-average sales organization
   (something also seen on &lt;a href="http://180stocks.github.io/day-17/"&gt;day 17&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worth-while profit margin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second point of "worth-while" profit
margin filtered out few pending companies
from the list: &lt;a href="http://www.hindindustries.net/"&gt;Hind Industries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.uniqueorganics.com/"&gt;Unique
Organics&lt;/a&gt;. Both have a brilliantly growing
top-line and exports, but the margins have
been terrible (less than 5%).&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">180Stocks</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>tag:180stocks.github.io,2013-10-11:day-24/</guid></item><item><title>Day 23 (KCP Sugar)</title><link>http://180stocks.github.io/day-23/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Another of the interesting and cyclical
company that was long pending in the list was
&lt;a href="http://www.kcpsugar.com/"&gt;KCP Sugar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I analysed the company on the same parameters
as &lt;a href="http://180stocks.github.io/day-22/"&gt;Tata Sponge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Company is engaged in the manufacture
and marketing of wide range of products
that can be broadly classified under three
groups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) Sugar (contributing over 90% of revenue)&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Bio-products&lt;br /&gt;
(3) Engineering unit for manufacture of solid liquid seperation equipments through its subsidering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market capitalization:&lt;/strong&gt; 192.21 Crores&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 Years average earnings:&lt;/strong&gt; 26 Crores&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Net worth:&lt;/strong&gt; 230 Crores&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company's profits started declining (from
PBT of 96 crores in 2006 to 7 crores in 2008)
when the &lt;em&gt;"sugar cycle reversed due to high
supply and low demand"&lt;/em&gt; in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="KCP Sugars 10 years data" src="http://180stocks.github.io/static/uploads/kcp-data.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long time the market capitalization
of the company has fallen below the net-worth. At the same
time the company has reduced the debt by half
(from sub 100 crores to sub 50 crores).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting development in the
industry is &lt;a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/04/04/india-sugar-sales-idINDEE93309R20130404"&gt;deregulation&lt;/a&gt; of sugar prices and supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together these provide an exciting
opportunity in the stock. To derive some intrinsic
valuation, I followed the easy technique of
compounding the 10 year average earnings by
risk free rate = 26 / (8.75%) = 297 Crores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the upcoming days I would try to improve
upon the concepts of intrinsic value as I
further read the &lt;a href="http://180stocks.github.io/day-22/"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">180Stocks</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>tag:180stocks.github.io,2013-10-09:day-23/</guid></item><item><title>Day 22 (Tata Sponge)</title><link>http://180stocks.github.io/day-22/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Today I continued with the
&lt;em&gt;"Theory of Common-Stock Investment"&lt;/em&gt; from the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Security-Analysis-Edition-Foreword-Editions/dp/0071592539"&gt;Security Analysis&lt;/a&gt;.
The thing that striked me the most was this
passage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Investing in de-growth businesses" src="http://180stocks.github.io/static/uploads/degrowth.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My aim for the day was to find one such
company which is &lt;em&gt;"long established, well
financed, important in its industry and
presumably destined to stay in business and
make profits indefinitely in the future, but
that have no speculative or growth appeal"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tatasponge.com/"&gt;Tata Sponge&lt;/a&gt; seemed to fit well into that
definition. The company has an average
earnings of Rs.70 crores over last decade and
the &lt;strong&gt;market capitalization is Rs.450
crores&lt;/strong&gt;. The net-worth is 640 crores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off this net-worth of 640 crores, &lt;strong&gt;Rs.361
crores is in fixed deposits and investments&lt;/strong&gt;.
Thus funds used in operations are around 278
crores (with 161 crores of depreciated fixed
assets) &lt;sup id="fnref:idle funds"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:idle funds" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over last few years, the operating margins of
the company have reduced from 30% levels to
current 13% levels. This has been mainly
because of the high raw-material prices (58%
of cost in 2008 vs 75% of cost in 2013).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Tata Sponge Quantitative Data" src="http://180stocks.github.io/static/uploads/tata-sponge-data.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the above volume data it doesn't look
that the company is going through a
permanent bad phase. The down-swing looks
purely cyclical, though it is hard to
estimate how long it can continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall it does look like a company where
there has been no recent growth, and the
valuations have depressed for this reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some concerns:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What kind of upside are we looking for in
   such cases (i.e. what is the good selling
   point)? (I would give the intrisic value
   of around 600 crores based on 3 kilns and
   the cash, though much will depend on how
   the company goes on to deploy this cash).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How long can it take to unlock the value
   (or rather how long can the depressed
   cycles continue)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess the answers to the above too must be
somewhere in this excellent &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Security-Analysis-Edition-Foreword-Editions/dp/0071592539"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:idle funds"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The excessive cash is
presumably for the development of &lt;a href="http://www.coal.nic.in/261112a.pdf"&gt;Radhikapur
Coal Block&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:idle funds" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">180Stocks</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>tag:180stocks.github.io,2013-10-08:day-22/</guid></item><item><title>Day 21 (De Nora)</title><link>http://180stocks.github.io/day-21/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href="http://180stocks.github.io/static/uploads/average_earning.xlsx"&gt;screened&lt;/a&gt; for companies based on the &lt;a href="http://180stocks.github.io/day-19/"&gt;"Theory of
Common-Stock Investment"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the names that came up was &lt;a href="http://www.denora.com/"&gt;De
Nora&lt;/a&gt;. The company's balance sheet looked
interesting as the company had bought-back shares
in the last two years at Rs.92 (current price is
Rs.101). The dividend payout also looked very
attractive (with yield of 7%). But going through
quarterly results, it turned out that there was a
one time profit of 6.21 Crores during September
2012 and that was deviating the ratios. On
removing the income from that quarter, the average
earnings shot-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most other companies in the list too had similar
one-off items, or the companies were in their
dying stages. It was still interesting to go
through the annual reports of some of them to know
about their reasons for downfall.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">180Stocks</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 07 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>tag:180stocks.github.io,2013-10-07:day-21/</guid></item><item><title>Day 20 (Jenburkt)</title><link>http://180stocks.github.io/day-20/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Have been stuck with fever and thus would 
keep it short today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the companies which attracted me recently
was &lt;a href="http://www.screener.in/company/?q=524731"&gt;Jenburkt Pharma&lt;/a&gt;. The company has a brilliant
dividend yield of 6.25% and a consistent dividend
record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenburkt is engaged in manufacturing and
marketing of speciality and high quality
pharmaceutical formulations and healthcare products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To come-up with some valuation, I took the
last year's dividend and compounded it at
historical growth rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last year dividend was Rs.4.20.
Required rate of return: 20%.
Lowest historical growth rate of profits:
17%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus I came up with a value of 4.20 * 100 /
(20-17) = 140. At current price of 66 it
looked quite attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The above was all wrong.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a good &lt;a href="http://www.valuepickr.com/forum/not-so-hidden-gems/577662220"&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; about the company
and its products. It seems the company's
products have a tremendous competition.
Probably the strength lies in the company's
distribution network or sales team. Over the
years these hasn't been much sales growth
(just 13% in 10 years). But the OPM margins
have shown a consistent up-trend (increased
from 7% to current 15%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there was one thing that had a real impact
from &lt;a href="http://180stocks.github.io/day-19/"&gt;yesterday's post&lt;/a&gt;, then it was to take
average earnings for the calculations. If we
take the average earnings, then the
valuations no longer look too attractive and
the dividends growth rate looks improbable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In last 4 annual reports the management has
been talking about growth opportunities but
the same haven't translated much in the
financials.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">180Stocks</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 06 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>tag:180stocks.github.io,2013-10-06:day-20/</guid></item><item><title>Day 19 (Theory and OCCL)</title><link>http://180stocks.github.io/day-19/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Today I began with the &lt;em&gt;"Theory of
Common-Stock Investment"&lt;/em&gt; from the
&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Security-Analysis-Edition-Foreword-Editions/dp/0071592539"&gt;Security Analysis&lt;/a&gt;
book. I always related Graham only with
deep-value/distressed/liquidation
investing, but in this chapter Graham
discusses and compares about the growth/trend
investing too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chapter defines [value] investments as
the ones which have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a suitable and established dividend return,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a stable and adequate earnings record, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a satisfactory backing of tangible assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In growth/trend investing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the three elements above stated
lost nearly all their significance,
and the third, the earnings record,
took on an entirely novel complexion.
The new theory or principle may be
summed up in the sentence: “The value
of a common stock depends entirely
upon what it will earn in the future.”
From this dictum the following corollaries were drawn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the dividend rate should have
slight bearing upon the value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That since no relationship apparently
existed between assets and
earning power, the asset value was
entirely devoid of importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That past earnings were significant
only to the extent that they indicated
what changes in the earnings were
likely to take place in the future.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham even says that it was a &lt;em&gt;"sound
premise used to support an unsound
conclusion."&lt;/em&gt; The prices rise &lt;em&gt;"for the
simple reason that common-stocks earned
more than they paid out in dividends and
thus the reinvested earnings added to
their worth."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the trend/growth theory is
attractive as long as &lt;em&gt;"common-stocks
earned more than the bond-interest rate
upon their cost. This would be true,
typically, of a stock earning $10 and
selling at 100."&lt;/em&gt; The moment we start
paying 20-40 times earnings, the
&lt;em&gt;"earning power is no greater than the bond-inter-
est rate, without the extra protection
afforded by a prior claim."&lt;/em&gt; The analysis
of the balance sheet and earnings is
still stressed upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Example of PE and trends" src="http://180stocks.github.io/static/uploads/new-era.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One company that looks close to the
concepts of "investing" is &lt;a href="http://www.occlindia.com/"&gt;Oriental
Carbon &amp;amp; Chemicals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company provides a dividend yield
of 5% (and more than 4% yield for each
of the last 4 years dividends). Thus the
company has &lt;em&gt;"suitable and established"&lt;/em&gt;
dividend return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10 years average earnings have
been 14.54 crores and 5 years average
earnings have been stable at 25 crores &lt;sup id="fnref:Disc"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:Disc" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; .
On the market capitalization of 98
crores the earnings are adequate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market capitalization is almost half of the
net-worth of 170 crores. Thus there is a
satisfactory backing of tangible assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:Disc"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to paucity of time I was not able
to make adjustments of "economic
earnings" for each year. On the balance
sheet too I only made the obvious
adjustments.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:Disc" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">180Stocks</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 05 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>tag:180stocks.github.io,2013-10-05:day-19/</guid></item><item><title>Day 18</title><link>http://180stocks.github.io/day-18/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Today I wanted to study &lt;a href="http://www.kcpsugar.com/"&gt;KCP Sugars&lt;/a&gt;. It
is supposed to be more of a commodity
and cyclical play. But it required too
much data to process and make sense off.
Thus even after collecting many of the
pieces and articles related to KCP
Sugars, I decided to postpone it and end
the day with something simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I screened for companies which had an
average growth of more than 20% in
atleast 5 years in the last decade.
It was an impressive list and most of the
multi-baggers (where PE got re-rated)
were in the list (along with many not-so-good names).
I sorted the list on PE,
excluded large caps and did a quick
scan of initial names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the companies were government
companies. I skipped over them. Most
others were textile related. One that
did attract a little was &lt;a href="http://www.ganeshaecosphere.com/"&gt;Ganesha
Ecosphere&lt;/a&gt;. It has an interesting
business of &lt;em&gt;"recycling of post consumer
PET bottle waste into Recycled Poyester
Staple Fibre (RPSF)."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.ganeshaecosphere.com/annual_reports.html"&gt;annual reports&lt;/a&gt; were
fairly detailed.  What quickly drove me
away was consistent equity dilution,
promoters pledging, high debt (with
scope for more borrowing in future) and
low tax.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">180Stocks</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>tag:180stocks.github.io,2013-10-04:day-18/</guid></item><item><title>Day 17 (Virat Industries)</title><link>http://180stocks.github.io/day-17/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Today I began with &lt;a href="http://www.screener.in/screens/3750/Good%20ROCE/"&gt;screening&lt;/a&gt; for
companies having good return on capital,
providing decent interest coverage ratio
and paying out dividends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting companies that
came up was &lt;a href="http://www.viratindustries.com/"&gt;Virat Industries&lt;/a&gt;.
I specifically liked the detailed annual
reports and the business details the
company provided &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; . On the fundamental
side, the stock provides a good dividend
yield of 6%. The company is debt-free,
has 1.5 crores of cash (against a market
capitalization of 11.76 crores), decent
return ratios and a consistent
performance record &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the PE of 4.5 and price near the book
value, the stock surely looked very
attractive (the &lt;a href="http://www.bseindia.com/corporates/Sharehold_Search.aspx?code=530521"&gt;promoters&lt;/a&gt; too have been
buying small quantities). I went on to
discuss the company with an expert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="About Virat Industries" src="http://180stocks.github.io/static/uploads/virat.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was asked to compare the company with &lt;a href="http://www.screener.in/company/?q=526851#pl"&gt;Arex
Industries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://180stocks.github.io/day-12/"&gt;Premco Global&lt;/a&gt;. Arex 
has amazing operating cashflows (more
than the company's market capitalization
for each of the last 4 years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with these companies is not
the operations or valuations, but the
scale of opportunities. These business
are too competitive in nature (due to a
commodity product) and it is
hard to scale their turnover beyond a
size. In textile, this is further
compounded due to competition from
Bangladesh and China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He explained that if we are going into
small-caps, then we should look for
superior returns. Look for businesses
which have potential of growing at more
than 20% year-on-year due to the
advantage of their small size. Otherwise
we are only aiming at average returns,
which can be obtained from safer
large-cap stocks too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This surely clicked to me. Their might
be some mis-pricing in these stocks, but
that reminds me of the &lt;a href="http://ycombinator.com/munger.html"&gt;essay by Charlie
Munger&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the long term, it's hard for a
stock to earn a much better return
than the business which underlies it
earns. If the business earns 6% on
capital over 40 years and you hold it
for that 40 years, you're not going to
make much different than a 6%
return—even if you originally buy it
at a huge discount. Conversely, if a
business earns 18% on capital over 20
or 30 years, even if you pay an
expensive looking price, you'll end up
with a fine result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the trick is getting into better
businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over last decade, Virat's stock has
given modest 15% returns, and Arex stock has gone
nowhere in the last 5 years, both inline
with their businesses performances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;

&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason Zweig wrote a wonderful essay

&lt;p&gt;2011 had an abnormally low OPM (of
5% against 23% the year before, but the
same can be blamed to the abnormal rise

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">180Stocks</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>tag:180stocks.github.io,2013-10-03:day-17/</guid></item><item><title>Day 16 (Alicon)</title><link>http://180stocks.github.io/day-16/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Today I began with another small-cap stock, &lt;a href="http://www.alicongroup.co.in/Default.aspx"&gt;Alicon Castalloy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Alicon Castalloy is one of the largest integrated aluminium casting manufacturing units in India offering end-to-end solutions across the entire value chain, and delivering best-in- class aluminium castings - Gravity, Low Pressure and Sand Casting."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The valuations of the company look over-beaten. The per-share book value is Rs.86 and the stock quotes at Rs.50. The company has a market capitalization of Rs.53 crores; the net-profit in FY13 was 16.87 crores (i.e. the PE of 3.15 times). The cash-flows are decent, and the company has been consistently paying out dividends (with the current yield of 3%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has a high debt, but &lt;a href="http://crisil.com/Ratings/RatingList/RatingDocs/AliconCastalloyLtd_03Oct12.html"&gt;CRISIL&lt;/a&gt; has given a stable A- rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary concerns seem to be the decreasing margins from 20% levels in early 2000s to current 10% levels. The overseas subsidiaries have been burning cash, though recent quarters look better. Going forward, there are reports which talk about upcoming expansions. Another increase in debt can impact the bottom-line negatively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the prospects of the company largely depend on better margins and growth. Current valuations seem to have already discounted much of the risks, and it looks interesting to me at these levels.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">180Stocks</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 02 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>tag:180stocks.github.io,2013-10-02:day-16/</guid></item><item><title>Day 15 (Acrysil)</title><link>http://180stocks.github.io/day-15/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://acrysil.com/"&gt;Acrysil&lt;/a&gt; is a small-cap company with market capitalization of only 53 crores. The company makes quartz kitchen sinks and says that &lt;em&gt;"we are the only company in all of Asia - and one of just a few companies worldwide – manufacturing quartz kitchen sinks to global standards of quality, durability and visual appeal. We have no competition in its class in India."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~80% of the revenues of the company comes from exports. Till 2011, the company had good margins of more than 20%. Over last few years the gross margins declined to 16% and coupled with higher interest costs, the bottom-line shrinked (even though revenues had a moderate growth).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently the company posted a very good &lt;a href="http://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachHis/Acrysil_Ltd_290713_Rst.pdf"&gt;June quarter&lt;/a&gt; and that got me interested into the stock. The company has had a good revenue growth and improvement in the margins can reward big. The management seems pretty ambitious about the growth in the &lt;a href="http://www.bseindia.com/bseplus/annualreport/524091/5240910313.pdf"&gt;annual reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would tag the stock as a risky bet but with good potential rewards. The things which I find very risky are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ambitious future plans&lt;/strong&gt;: Company aims to be the "undisputed ‘No 1’ position – the top-most one-stop brand for every requirement in kitchen products – every fitting, accessory, appliance and utility."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this, the company plans "to further increase domestic sales by launching new models, catering to new projects and aggressive promotion."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weak financials&lt;/strong&gt;: The cash-flows are relatively weak with around 70% realisation of the operating profits over last 5 years. The tax payout is also relative low at 20%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other things&lt;/strong&gt;: The company has 4 subsidiaries (with a couple of them in losses). The company does not post the consolidated results on the quarterly basis. I also found the managerial remuneration to be on a higher side (20% of the net-profits). In 2008 the company came up with a preferential allotment to promoters and diluted 15% of the stake of the other shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the kinds of ambitions and historical growth, the company does look interesting. The new lines of products and new-brand building can take some time to break-even and thus I will keep a close eye on the margins and debt levels in the upcoming quarters.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">180Stocks</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>tag:180stocks.github.io,2013-10-01:day-15/</guid></item><item><title>Day 14 (Kewal Kiran)</title><link>http://180stocks.github.io/day-14/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Today I went through the brilliant &lt;a href="http://fundooprofessor.wordpress.com/2013/09/25/a-killer-puzzle/"&gt;Killer Puzzle&lt;/a&gt; shared by Prof. Bakshi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has an excellent set of financials, with the pre-tax returns of 64% on the net operating assets. The returns are supported by clean cash-flows and dividends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main questions were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How is the company able to earn extra-ordinary margins (of over 25%)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are these margins maintainable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How should the company be valued?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the company came with the IPO in 2006, I began with the &lt;a href="http://www.sebi.gov.in/dp/kewalfinal.pdf"&gt;red-herring prospectus&lt;/a&gt; to understand the reasons for IPO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Kewal Kiran Objects of IPO" src="http://180stocks.github.io/static/uploads/kewal-ipo.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also went through the &lt;a href="http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-05-24/news/29577707_1_gini-jony-spykar-sanjay-vakharia"&gt;articles on Spykar and Kuotons&lt;/a&gt; to learn from their failures. It was mostly the rapid pace at which they opened stores and took debt. Thus increasing the operational costs of rents and inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kewal Kiran seems to be doing okay on that front. Arvind's Flying Machine closely resembles the company's segment, but the &lt;a href="http://www.arvindmills.com/pdf/annaul_finacial_reporting/Annual%20Report%20-%202012-13%20-%20ALBL.pdf"&gt;raw-material cost&lt;/a&gt; is 50% in contrast to 40% in case of Kiran. Thus there must be some operating efficiencies too in the case of Kewal Kiran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an old &lt;a href="http://www.theequitydesk.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=2650"&gt;discussion on a forum&lt;/a&gt;, one of the comments (from Prof. Neeraj Marathe) said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their business model is a lot different from others. What they do is SELL the entire inventory to the franchisee (shop owner). This reduces a lot of working capital, explaining the better balance sheet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, whenever there are a lot of stores added (not their own), you will see a jump in sales. This is cause the franchisee has to set up shop with about Rs.20 lakh worth of clothes..(i talked with the shop owner near my place) whether the shop manages to sell the clothes to customer or not, KKCL books the sales. (nothing wrong in it..quite a good policy) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/28494399/Blog%20Links/The%20Smart%20Way.pdf"&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; from IVY League summarises the business best:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We must look at fashion and not garments as a business. Fashion is all about marketing, trends, understanding the consumers, social changes, and what’s going to sell. You need not necessarily produce what’s going to sell. You could outsource it. GAP does not produce a single garment in-house. Lacoste which is available all over the world employs only 53 employees. They don’t make or sell a single product.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I love the company's balance-sheet and the business model. But I am unable to find a proper valuation for it. In next few days I will try to compare it with CERA, which looks cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have a few doubts and concerns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why so high margins? (I visited one of their K-Lounge in city and didn't get a very good feel).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The high number of stores closing recently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">180Stocks</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>tag:180stocks.github.io,2013-09-30:day-14/</guid></item><item><title>Day 13</title><link>http://180stocks.github.io/day-13/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;After a little gap, I resumed with &lt;a href="http://www.suven.com/"&gt;Suven Life Sciences Ltd&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company primarily has 3 main segments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CRAMS (Contract Research &amp;amp; Manufacturing)&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;"brings in new technologies and cost savings in manufacturing"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DDDSS (Drug Discovery &amp;amp; Development Support System)&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;"brings in speed in preclinical development and clinical trials thus reducing
time and money spent"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research &amp;amp; Development&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;"brings in innovation"&lt;/em&gt; in the field of Central Nervous System (CNS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="FY13 Segment results of Suven" src="http://180stocks.github.io/static/uploads/suven-segment.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has had a consistent revenue growth of over 25% during the last few years. The profits too have shown a geometric growth during this period. 90% of the company's revenue is from exports, and primarily comes from CRAMS segment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The margins of the company have been abnormally high in the CRAMS segment. The same might be attributed to the unique research work the company has been doing in CNS segment. The rupee depreciation should also be highly rewarding for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another exciting thing about the company is the upcoming &lt;em&gt;"addition of a new green field site at Vizag with an outlay of around Rs 100crs which in turn adds to the growth and profitability in the years to come."&lt;/em&gt; With all this innovation, patents, research and USFDA approvals, the company looks attractive at a market capitalization of Rs.528 Crores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are a &lt;strong&gt;few points which make me give a miss to this stock&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amalgamation of &lt;em&gt;Asian Clinic Trails&lt;/em&gt; in 2007 is an interesting one. I feel that the company overpaid (in form of equity shares worth more than 30 Crores at that time) for an acquisition of net assets worth 2.73 crores. The resulting promoter's equity raised from 54.5% to 61.5%, while also created additional reserves in the books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per the FY 2013 annual report, the company has a surplus bank balance and deposits of over 20 crores. I see it as a weak financial management to have a corresponding borrowings of ~100 crores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock has been far too &lt;a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/stock-charts/suvenlifesciences/charts/SLS01#SLS01"&gt;volatile&lt;/a&gt; along with huge volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">180Stocks</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 05 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>tag:180stocks.github.io,2013-09-05:day-13/</guid></item><item><title>Day 12</title><link>http://180stocks.github.io/day-12/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I studied &lt;a href="http://www.premcoglobal.com/"&gt;Premco Global Ltd&lt;/a&gt; today. It is a manufacturer &lt;em&gt;"of Woven and Knitted Elastic and non-Elastic Narrow Fabric and Webbing (4mm-250mm), and caters to the apparel, lingerie, sports-related, medical, footwear, luggage, furnishing, and automotive industries."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a hyper competitive market with slow growth and low margins. But the company has posted phenomenal profits during the &lt;a href="http://www.screener.in/company/?q=530331#quarters"&gt;last few quarters&lt;/a&gt;. The current market capitalization of the company is 8.20 crores, providing a dividend yield of 7% (the company has been consistent with the dividends) and trading at around 1 time its trailing-12-months profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went through the company's annual reports of last few years, but it don't provide much business details. The annual report of 2013 is awaited. Couldn't find the annual reports of &lt;a href="http://www.sky-india.com/about_us.htm"&gt;Sky Industries Ltd&lt;/a&gt; too, which (claims to be the largest manufacturer in this field).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keypoints from notes and other reports: The company has 4 plants and the book value is around 3 times the market price. Around 50% of the company's revenues are from exports. The promoters did a small preferential allotment at Rs.28 per share in 2012-13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing is that though the high profits have repeated and continued in last 4 quarters, the price has dropped by 20%. Don't know if this was because the stock came under the call-auction mechanism, or because the markets are not expecting the margins to sustain. Either way, even if the margins do not sustain, the company will still be at a PE of 3 with a good dividend track record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual report of 2013 will be something to look forward. How the company utilizes the new profit funds (over 6 crores in last 3 quarters) and how long the margins sustain will be worth digging into. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="http://libraryequity.blogspot.in/2013/01/premco-global-ltd-elastic-profits.html"&gt;detailed blogpost&lt;/a&gt; provides some more details.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">180Stocks</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>tag:180stocks.github.io,2013-08-19:day-12/</guid></item><item><title>Day 11</title><link>http://180stocks.github.io/day-11/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The company I studied today was &lt;a href="http://www.piindustries.com/"&gt;PI Industries Ltd&lt;/a&gt;. It was part of the peer comparison in CRISIL's report on Dhanuka Industries which I studied on &lt;a href="http://180stocks.github.io/day-6/"&gt;day 6&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has issued new shares during each of the last 4 years. Thus it required some efforts to prepare the adjusted net profit figures and to evaluate the issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="PI Industries adjusted net profits" src="http://180stocks.github.io/static/uploads/pi-adjusted.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has two main verticals. In domestic market it sells the agri-input products (agro-chemicals, fertilizers and plant nutrients), and does the contract research and manufacturing (CRAMS) for its foreign clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the company raised 117 crores through a qualified-institutional-placement (QIP), by issuing the shares at 609.60 (dilution of 8%). The funds being used to setup a new facility at Jambusar SEZ to &lt;em&gt;"provide a fillip to the export volumes."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, the company has had an asset-turnover of around 4 times (current net block is of 480 crores). If the capacities are utilized and the company is able to get the export orders, then it can see a turnover of around 2000 crores in a few years (FY 2013's turnover was 1245 crores and FY14Q1 turnover was 400 crores).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current market capitalization of the company is 1758 crores. Based on the annualized earnings of last quarter, the company is at a forward PE of around 10-12 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn't a high margin of safety and visibility at these levels, but it is a stock I will keep an eye on.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">180Stocks</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>tag:180stocks.github.io,2013-08-15:day-11/</guid></item><item><title>Day 10</title><link>http://180stocks.github.io/day-10/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Today I shuffled through several companies trading at their multi-year lows. Some businesses were pure cyclical and some were too complex to understand. In the end &lt;a href="http://www.iclbelting.com/index.html"&gt;International Conveyors Ltd&lt;/a&gt;. looked interesting. Its market capitalization has been on a down-slide from 250 crore levels to 67 crores, while the top-line has shown a consistent growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company is &lt;em&gt;"one of the country’s largest PVC Belting exporters to USA and Canada. Company enjoys India’s leading 40% share in the PVC Conveyor Belting market for underground mines. The company’s manufacturing facilities are located in Aurangabad, Maharashtra that has the largest manufacturing facility in the world."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began with the company's 2007 annual report. That year the top-line had grown by 39% and the bottom-line had more than doubled. Company had an impressive order-book of over 20 crores (40% of 2007s sales) and it expected &lt;em&gt;"to report two years of straight growth: a 40 per cent revenue increase in 2007-08 followed by 40 per cent in 2008-09."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The balance sheet reported an increase in loan from 13 crores to 30 crores. Simultaneously, there was an increase in the gross block from 7 crores to 26 crores. That year, the company had added 19 crores of windmills funded out of debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were seen in over the next couple of years. While the topline did grow over 30% in 2008, the bottom-line decreased by half under the interest pressure. Subsequently, in 2009, the company raised money through warrants to pay back the loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per the 2012 annual report, the loan has again risen to 39 crores (from 19 crores in 2010) and another windmill of 8.74 crores has been added to the gross block.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">180Stocks</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>tag:180stocks.github.io,2013-08-13:day-10/</guid></item><item><title>Day 9</title><link>http://180stocks.github.io/day-9/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Today I studied &lt;a href="http://www.dynemic.com/"&gt;Dynemic Products Ltd&lt;/a&gt;, which can be an example of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.valuebull.com/Cigar+Butts"&gt;cigar butt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; investing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This company has a market capitalization of 16 crores. It is &lt;em&gt;"into manufacturing of food color, lake color, D&amp;amp;C colors, salt free dyes, dye intermediates which is used as an essential ingredient of food, drug, cosmetic, personal care and FMCG industry."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a highly competitive business due to its commodity nature.
Company's 10-year-average growth rate is only 17% in-spite of a major
expansion in 2008 (company came up with an IPO in 2006). There have been constant margin pressures over last few years and the operating margins have fallen from 16% to 11% levels. The 10-year-average profit growth rate has been only 14.58%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013 annual report, the company says the lower margins are &lt;em&gt;"largely attributed to MEE plant, which has incurred Rs.4.57 cores on working capital this year and Rs.47 lacs on fixed assets which is a step ahead for pollution control and GPCB norms."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MEE plant is a regulatory requirement and impacts the company negatively as unorganized/small competitors are not required to comply with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the valuation side, the stock looks over-beaten. The company came up with an IPO in 2006 at Rs.35 (valuing the company at 39 crores and 10 times its earnings). The company has paid consistent dividends of around 1.5 crores each year and provides a dividend yield of 9%. The current price is around half its book value and the rupee depreciation should be a big positive for the company (as 70% of the company's revenue are from exports).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would still give the company a miss primarily because of slow growth, low return ratios, lower booked depreciation and highly &lt;a href="http://www.screener.in/company/?q=532707#quarters"&gt;volatile quarters&lt;/a&gt;. Though the stock returns look attractive in micro-caps, I would prefer &lt;a href="http://180stocks.github.io/day-7/"&gt;Gulshan Polyols&lt;/a&gt; over it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">180Stocks</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>tag:180stocks.github.io,2013-08-12:day-9/</guid></item><item><title>Day 8</title><link>http://180stocks.github.io/day-8/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to study the companies which are leaders in their fields. One such company which often comes up on screens is &lt;a href="http://www.himatsingka.com/"&gt;Himatsingka Seide Ltd&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://crisil.com/Ratings/RatingList/RatingDocs/HimatsingkaSeideLimited_120413.html"&gt;CRISIL's report&lt;/a&gt; describes them the best:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Himatsingka group has been a leading manufacturer and the largest exporter of silk and silk-blended drapery and upholstery fabrics in India for the past eight years. The group, backed by its team of designers in India, the US, and Europe, offers more than 10,000 products, and can create 1500 products annually. It has further established itself in the home textiles segment, where it was already present with high-end drapery and upholstery products, through its bed linen business. The bed linen operations, which are fully integrated with a manufacturing unit at Hassan (Karnataka), three acquired global distribution companies, and a retail arm with 14 stores, account for about 90 per cent of the Himatsingka group’s total revenues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exciting thing about the company is its &lt;strong&gt;market capitalization of just 273 crores&lt;/strong&gt;. The &lt;a href="http://www.screener.in/company/?q=514043&amp;amp;con=1&amp;amp;c=152#pl"&gt;top-line and EBIDT levels&lt;/a&gt; have been pretty strong in comparison to the valuations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2006, the company raised money through GDRs and the net worth stood at around 600 crores (and has stayed at around same levels until 2013). Since then, the company has done aggressive overseas acquisitions which tightly integrates with the company's production. This has led to the creation of 532 crores of (intangible) goodwill in the balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The real problem has been the derivate losses on the company's foreign currency contracts. In 2009, the company posted a loss of 74 crores.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Extract from the 2009 annual report)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The financial performance during the year has been primarily impacted by a Rs. 43 crore loss attributable to closure / provisioning on account of foreign exchange derivative contracts, a Rs 18 crore loss incurred on account of foreign exchange translation/realization and a loss of Rs. 15 crore on account of the stabilization of the Bed Linen plant in the first half of the financial year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not sure whether the loss was a one time item or can repeat again (considering there is again a similar volatility in exchange rates). There is still a foreign currency loan of $136 lacs, hedging contracts outstanding of more than $200 lacs and a little extra-volatility can take the bottom-line in any direction. As there are far too many components involved, I convinced myself to watch this stock only from a distance, even though it looked very attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still wanted to know why the losses occurred and how does accounting work in foreign exchange contracts. 2008's &lt;a href="http://180stocks.github.io/static/uploads/dollar-chart.jpg"&gt;dollar vs rupee&lt;/a&gt; chart told a part of the story and &lt;a href="http://www.sify.com/finance/india-incs-experiment-with-derivatives-news-derivatives-jegr80jdacg.html"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; provided a good commentary. But the real gem was &lt;a href="http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/accounting-of-derivative-losses/article1621825.ece"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; by Dolphy D'Souza which explained the hedge accounting, knock-in &amp;amp; knockouts and the role of Swiss Franc.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">180Stocks</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>tag:180stocks.github.io,2013-08-08:day-8/</guid></item><item><title>Day 7</title><link>http://180stocks.github.io/day-7/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I studied &lt;a href="http://www.gulshanindia.com/"&gt;Gulshan Polyols&lt;/a&gt; today. This company is amongst the largest producers &lt;sup id="fnref:producers"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:producers" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of sorbitol and calcium carbonate in India. The interesting thing about the company is its slow-growing-boring-business on one side, and the extreme low valuation on the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 50% of the company's revenue come from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorbitol"&gt;sorbitol&lt;/a&gt; and 40% from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_carbonate"&gt;calcium carbonate&lt;/a&gt;. The company has a clientele of large corporates &lt;sup id="fnref:clientele"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:clientele" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; including Colgate, Unilever, Asian Paints etc. But the revenue growth has been nominal at 7-15%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the valuations side, the company is available at a &lt;strong&gt;market capitalization of just 48 crores&lt;/strong&gt;. There is a cash of 28 crores on the &lt;a href="http://www.bseindia.com/bseplus/annualreport/532457/5324570313.pdf"&gt;balance sheet&lt;/a&gt;, and the last year's net profit was 24 crores. Cash flow from operations for each of the last 5 years has been more than 20 crores. Company has been consistently paying the dividends and I really couldn't dig anything negative about the management (i.e. no subsidiaries, related party transactions, preferential allotments, windmills or insider trading). The company also has 6 plants (in 5 states), 150 acres of land and has a workforce of over 1500 employees. &lt;a href="http://www.careratings.com/Portals/0/CareAdmin/CompanyFiles/PR/GULSHAN%20POLYOLS%20LTD.-01082013.pdf"&gt;CARE&lt;/a&gt; has consistently given a &lt;a href="http://www.careratings.com/Portals/0/CareAdmin/CompanyFiles/PR/GULSHAN%20POLYOLS%20LTD.-01082013.pdf"&gt;A/A1 rating&lt;/a&gt; to the company's borrowings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the large negatives, I could only find the low rate of taxation. Will try to collect more details about it and do some groundwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">180Stocks</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>tag:180stocks.github.io,2013-08-06:day-7/</guid></item><item><title>Day 6</title><link>http://180stocks.github.io/day-6/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Today I picked up &lt;a href="http://www.dhanuka.com/"&gt;Dhanuka Agritech Ltd&lt;/a&gt;. It &lt;em&gt;"manufactures a wide range of agro-chemicals like herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, miticides, plant growth regulators in various forms – liquid, dust, powder and granules. The Company has a pan-India presence through its marketing offices in all major states in India, with a network of more than 7,000 distributors/ dealers"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years the company has had a good steady growth of around 15% in top-line and 25% in bottom-line. The company introduces new brands and products each year, and has many technical tie-ups with international companies like Nissan, DuPont, Dow, FMC etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing in the company's 2013 annual report was its expansion plan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Company has bought 10 acres of land at Keshwana in Rajasthan for setting up a new manufacturing unit of International standards with maximum automation. The expected capex is to the tune of Rs.45-50 crores. The unit is expected to be operational by 2014 and will triple the existing manufacturing capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Company has been allotted approx. 1,50,000 sq.mtr. Industrial plot in Dahej, which is a Chemical zone in Gujarat, for future expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would help your Company to achieve its objective of robust growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically the company has had a very good asset-turnover ratio (with sales of 646 crores on the net block of just 40 crores). The reason has been the 'formulation' manufacturing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Formulation' manufacturers: These are manufacturers of final product from technical grade pesticides (the usable form of pesticides). This is quite an asset light model and serves mostly B2C segment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above expansion can be a big trigger if the capacities are utilized. The company has also signed Amitabh Bachan as its brand ambassador recently. This too may provide a good growth going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/mSy1HwUEWYI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company's current market capitalization is 675 crores. The business has a good ROE of over 25%, but the stock price is 2.5 times its book value. The major risk is the company's import exposure of more than 30 percent of its raw material costs. It will be interesting to see if the company is able to pass on the recent rupee depreciation in its price sensitive market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/news_html_files/news_attachment/2013/Dhanuka-Agritech_CRISIL_110713.pdf"&gt;CRISIL's report&lt;/a&gt; has reported the company as fairly valued at the current levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding &lt;a href="http://180stocks.github.io/day-5/"&gt;Ashiana Housing's value of constructed area&lt;/a&gt;, I couldn't find the details regarding it in the given reports. Will try to send a mail regarding it to the company.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">180Stocks</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>tag:180stocks.github.io,2013-08-05:day-6/</guid></item><item><title>Day 5</title><link>http://180stocks.github.io/day-5/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The two stocks, Financial Technologies and MCX, had another &lt;a href="http://capitalmind.in/2013/08/nsel-might-have-dummy-stocks-in-what-seems-to-be-a-financing-scheme/"&gt;free-fall&lt;/a&gt; today. It was tempting to analyze them. The two primary questions were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How impactful can be the damage of NSEL for Financial Tech?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is MCX falling?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding answer to both of the above was almost impossible. Sometime in the future the things might look obvious in the hindsight, but for now, they remain unanswered. From the various discussions, it was pretty clear that it was not the case of "unjustified pessimism."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The events are best covered by &lt;a href="http://capitalmind.in/2013/08/nsel-might-have-dummy-stocks-in-what-seems-to-be-a-financing-scheme/"&gt;CapitalMind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://fundooprofessor.wordpress.com/2013/08/02/those-warehouse-receipts-again-and-what-to-do-about-them/"&gt;Prof. Bakshi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a conference call of &lt;a href="http://www.screener.in/company/?q=523716&amp;amp;con=1"&gt;Ashiana Housing&lt;/a&gt; later during the day. Brief inputs told that this is a real estate company which is &lt;em&gt;clean&lt;/em&gt;. At current levels, most real-estate companies look deeply under-valued, but hardly any of them want to share the wealth with their shareholders. It is clearly reflected by other real-estate companies' profit margins which are around 15%. Ashiana is among the few which have the margins of over 26% and which also provide proper pricing details on their website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began with 2013 numbers as the revenues have dropped by almost half. The 2013 annual report answered: &lt;em&gt;"the year 2013 was low as expected. The reason being the change in accounting policy from POC (percentage of completion) to the contract completion method."&lt;/em&gt; This is a conservative accounting policy and seems to have hit the company even more as most of their earlier projects have just completed, and the new ones have just begun. The company recommends to use ECA (equivalent constructed area) and cash from operations as better comparative indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company does seem to have a very good &lt;a href="http://www.indianrealestateforum.com/real-estate-bhiwadi/t-ashiana-town-bhiwadi-24541.html"&gt;brand benefit&lt;/a&gt;. They don't sell through brokers (instead incentivizes the buyer if he comes through referral), restrict reselling upto 60% payment (approx 1.5 years) and treat land as raw-material (and not build up land banks). These can provide a very long term benefit to a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valuation wise, the company has a market capitalization of 360 Crores. There is a cash of 52 crores and a small loan of 11 crores. Thus the enterprise value is 319 crores. Against this, the company has an inventory of 231 crores. I am unsure about how much of it is the value of constructed area. I am also unsure about the percentage of constructed area to total salable area. The clarity on these two figures can give a good estimate about the value of total project, and consequently about the margin of safety available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualitatively the company looks great to keep an eye on. I will try to collect more details about the missing two figures tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.s: Found this &lt;a href="http://www.firstpost.com/economy/why-car-sales-are-falling-but-not-realty-prices-658909.html"&gt;interesting article&lt;/a&gt; while digging the above.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">180Stocks</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 02 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>tag:180stocks.github.io,2013-08-02:day-5/</guid></item><item><title>Day 4</title><link>http://180stocks.github.io/day-4/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I looked at &lt;a href="http://www.screener.in/company/?q=532493"&gt;Astral Microwave&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://180stocks.github.io/day-2/"&gt;Day 2&lt;/a&gt;, while looking at defense companies. The stock looked interesting as it was showing a very good year-on-year growth and yet available at a multi-year low (at a market capitalization of 276 crores).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began reading the company's 2006 annual report. It was an exceptional year as the company's top-line grew by over 50%. Net profit that year was of 37 crores (and has stayed below it until 2013). That year company declared a 1:1 bonus (along with a stock split in 5:1 ratio). The R&amp;amp;D expenditure was 18% of revenue and the annual report was pretty optimistic about the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="From 2006 Annual Report" src="http://180stocks.github.io/static/uploads/astra_microwave.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at the &lt;a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/stock-charts/astramicrowaveproducts/charts/AMP01#AMP01"&gt;historical price&lt;/a&gt; chart to find that the market had been even more optimistic and had valued the company at whooping 1000 crores (37 times its annual earnings).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year, company reported the &lt;em&gt;"end of major production orders of ground based radar sub-system which dominated both the top line and bottom line growth of the company in the last two financial years."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson of the day was never to overpay for a stock, no matter how tempting the prospects might be.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At current levels, the stock is at 7 times its earnings, has &lt;a href="http://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachHis/Astra_Microwave_Products_Ltd_240713_Rst.pdf"&gt;book orders&lt;/a&gt; of 1000+ crores &lt;em&gt;"executable in the next 24 to 30 months"&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.bseindia.com/corporates/Insider_Trading.aspx?scripcd=532493"&gt;promoters are buying&lt;/a&gt;. Words in the &lt;a href="http://nseindia.com/annual_reports/AR_ASTRAMICRO_2011_2012_03072012103025.zip"&gt;annual report (2012)&lt;/a&gt; have become more cautious and it does not seem that one might be "overpaying" at these levels. But, I will still like to miss this opportunity and will look for businesses which are lesser dependent on government.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">180Stocks</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>tag:180stocks.github.io,2013-08-01:day-4/</guid></item><item><title>Day 3</title><link>http://180stocks.github.io/day-3/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Today I started with &lt;a href="http://www.screener.in/company/?q=504966"&gt;Tinplate Company of India Ltd&lt;/a&gt;. It is a &lt;strong&gt;Tata Enterprise&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;"largest indigenous producer of tin coated and tin free steel sheets in India"&lt;/em&gt;. The company has been in the business for over 90 years. Yet the &lt;strong&gt;market capitalization is only 358 crores&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a coincidence that today only I got a copy of the latest &lt;a href="http://www.capitalmarket.com/magazine/contents.asp?volno=28&amp;amp;Issno=11"&gt;Capital Market magazine&lt;/a&gt;. The cover story is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;"small forever."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The article covers the case-studies of &lt;a href="http://www.screener.in/company/?q=506685"&gt;Ultramarine &amp;amp; Pigments&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.screener.in/company/?q=509820"&gt;Paper Products Ltd&lt;/a&gt;. Both the companies have been into their business for decades, and yet have failed to scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case of Ultramarine, &lt;em&gt;"though the company has reported profit over the last one decade; out of last 10 years, it reported decline in profit in five years."&lt;/em&gt; The reason associated is &lt;em&gt;"over-dependence on few clients."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paper Products has multiple big FMCG clients including Levers, Nestle, Cadbury, Coca Cola etc. Yet the company hasn't been able to scale as it &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;"is sandwiched between big customers on one hand and is a commodity play on the other hand."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to see that in both of the above cases, the companies were in a sort of commodity business and that their clients were big corporations. Thus the other party got to dictate the terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming back to Tinplate Company, tinplate is widely used in packaging industry. Infact 55% of the domestic demand is met through imports. But it is the other substitutes (tetra pack, pet, plastics as well as non-prime tin) that pose a major substitution threat due to their cost competitiveness. It is very similar to the above two cases of commodities and big customers. There is some hope for good growth in top-line but the growth in bottom-line looks doubtful. Valuations too don't look too cheap to provide a good margin of safety at these levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://180stocks.github.io/day-2/"&gt;Yesterday&lt;/a&gt; I also talked about &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.screener.in/company/?q=532493"&gt;Astra Microwave&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; while studying defense stocks. Well, I will need to delay it again for tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">180Stocks</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>tag:180stocks.github.io,2013-07-31:day-3/</guid></item><item><title>Day 2</title><link>http://180stocks.github.io/day-2/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;One of my friends is in army and wants to invest into stocks. While talking to him over phone, I started looking at the listed companies into defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began with &lt;a href="http://www.screener.in/company/?q=533339"&gt;Zen Technologies&lt;/a&gt;. The company manufactures simulators and has a market capitalization of only 60 crores. The earnings have been very volatile over the years (63 crores in 2009 vs 17 crores in 2011 vs 100 crores in 2012 vs 40 crores in 2013). The company has an order book of &lt;a href="http://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachHis/ZEN_Technologies_Ltd_300513_Rst.pdf"&gt;37 crores&lt;/a&gt; and an OPM of around 30% (also very volatile). Company's recent buy back did bring some excitement, but it was a minor quantity of 17000 shares (0.19%). Due to the volatility in earnings of the company, I found it hard to derive some valuations for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bseindia.com/download/Research_Report/Report/533339/2012-13/BSE%20Company%20Research%20Report%20-%20Zen%20Technologies%20Ltd.pdf"&gt;CARE's report&lt;/a&gt; on Zen Technology mentioned about Bharat Electronics among the listed peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Electronics"&gt;Bharat Electronics&lt;/a&gt; is a PSU. It &lt;em&gt;"primarily manufactures advanced electronic products for the Indian Armed Forces."&lt;/em&gt; Market cap is just around 9000 crores with a cash of around 5000 crores in the March'13 &lt;a href="http://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachHis/Bharat_Electronics_Ltd_300513.pdf"&gt;balance sheet&lt;/a&gt;. The annual profits are around 900 crores. This makes it a very attractive stock to follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the risk here, as is with all the other PSUs, is that there are elections within the next 12 months. The experts believe that the cash from balance sheets of the PSUs will suddenly disappear. Some unnecessary deal, merger, expansion, subsidiary etc will happen and the cash will be gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barring the last year, the sales growth have been slow in the company. There are risks about the cash management, and a large distrust in promoters. For these reasons, I will watch this stock from a distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.screener.in/company/?q=532493"&gt;Astra Microwave&lt;/a&gt; looked good among other peers. I will cover it tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">180Stocks</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>tag:180stocks.github.io,2013-07-30:day-2/</guid></item><item><title>Day 1</title><link>http://180stocks.github.io/day-1/</link><description>&lt;h2&gt;What is this about?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://jenniferdewalt.com/index.html"&gt;Jennifer&lt;/a&gt; wanted to master web-development in 180 days. The way she proceeded was to build 1 website each day. That is crazy, and the &lt;a href="http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com/"&gt;results are fabulous&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to try the same craziness on stocks. Over the next half year, I will try to learn more about investing concepts, businesses and industries. Each day I will try to study at least 1 company and write a brief post about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 1:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked up &lt;a href="http://www.screener.in/company/?q=532899"&gt;Kaveri Seeds&lt;/a&gt; for today. It is a seasonal company and its results are due within a week or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has an excellent business. It provides high quality hybrid seeds which increases the crop's yield. In 2008, it introduced revolutionary hybrid BT-Cotton seeds, which provided wonderful returns not only to the farmers but also to the shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="http://www.kaveriseeds.in/AR-06-07.pdf"&gt;2007 annual report&lt;/a&gt; company mentioned that &lt;em&gt;"once a hybrid seed is developed and introduced, its acceptability gradually declines from year to year."&lt;/em&gt; Five years later, in the 2012 annual report it says &lt;em&gt;"cotton, considered by many as a mature market, we expect to gain market share because of our differentiated and high-yielding hybrid seeds portfolio."&lt;/em&gt; At the same time the company is optimistic about the developments in hybrid rice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The balance sheet of the company is one of the most amazing ones. &lt;strong&gt;Of the total 858 crores of assets, 253 crores is financed from advance from customers. Another 237 crores is financed from creditors.&lt;/strong&gt; June quarter is the most important quarter for the company and thus the closing stock from March balance sheet gives a good estimate about the upcoming results. The March'13 inventory is Rs.491 crores (against 303 crores previous year). Going by these and the good monsoons, I estimate June sales to grow by anything between 30% to 75%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the above numbers, the forward PE is of around 9 to 12 times. At current PE of 16 (market cap of 2131 crores), it seems that the market has already discounted this upcoming quarter's growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that makes me concerned is that the company's annual report does not talk much about the business process. For a 2000 crore company, I expected the details about how the company's seeds are better and the differences in yields (some statistical and quantitative data). I also expected more details about the reasons for the robust growths (i.e whether the company expanded in new states or was it some real yield magic). Another little danger area is of lower taxation. This is one area where the peers (I checked Bayer Cropscience) seem more transparent about the processes and paying higher taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is enough &lt;a href="http://www.valuepickr.com/forum/not-so-hidden-gems/608487840"&gt;ground work&lt;/a&gt; available and I will take a little time to go through it.
